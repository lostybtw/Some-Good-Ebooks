  <body dir="auto"><h1>FINCH</h1><p>Day 9</p><p>By Monday morning, it’s clear that ’80s Finch has to go. For one thing, the picture of him in
the 
Bartlett Dirt
 is not flattering. He looks unnervingly wholesome—I suspect he’s a goody-
good, what with all the not smoking and vegetarianism and turned-up collars. And, for two,
he just doesn’t feel right to me. He’s the kind of guy who’s probably great with teachers and
pop quizzes and who actually doesn’t mind driving his mom’s Saturn, but I don’t trust him
not to screw things up with girls. More specifically, I don’t trust him to get anywhere with
Violet Markey.</p><p>I meet Charlie at Goodwill during third period. There’s one down by the train station, in an
area that used to be nothing but abandoned, burned-out factories and graffiti. Now it’s been
“regentrified,” which means it got a new coat of paint and someone decided to pay attention
to it.</p><p>Charlie brings Brenda for fashion backup, even though nothing she wears ever matches,
something she swears she does on purpose. While Charlie talks up one of the salesgirls, Bren
follows me from rack to rack yawning. She flips halfheartedly through hangers of leather
jackets. “What exactly are we looking for?”</p><p>I say, “I need to be regentrified.” She yawns again without covering her mouth, and I can
see her fillings. “Late night?”</p><p>She grins, bright-pink lips spreading wide. “Amanda Monk had a party Saturday night. I
made out with Gabe Romero.” In addition to being Amanda’s boyfriend, Roamer is the
biggest prick in school. For some reason, Bren has had a thing for him since freshman year.</p><p>“Will he remember it?”</p><p>Her grin fades a little. “He was pretty wasted, but I left one of these in his pocket.” She
holds up a hand and waves her fingers. One of her blue plastic fingernails is missing. “And,
just in case, my nose ring.”</p><p>“I thought you looked different today.”</p><p>“That’s just the glow.” She’s more awake now. She claps her hands together and rubs them
all mad-scientist-like. “So what are we looking for?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Something a little less squeaky clean, maybe a little sexier. I’m done with
the eighties.”</p><p>She frowns. “Is this about what’s-her-name? The skinny chick?”</p><p>“Violet Markey, and she’s not skinny. She has hips.”</p><p>“And a sweet, sweet ass.” Charlie has joined us now.</p><p>“No.” Bren is shaking her head so hard and fast, it looks as if she’s having a seizure. “You
don’t dress to please a girl—especially not a girl like that. You dress to please yourself. If she
doesn’t like you for you, then you don’t need her.” All of this would be fine if I knew exactly</p>

        <p>who 
me
 for 
me
 was. She goes on: “This is the girl with the blog, the one that actress Gemma
Sterling likes? The one who saved her ‘crazy classmate’ from jumping? Well, screw her and
her skinny, skinny ass.” Bren hates all girls who aren’t at least a size twelve.</p><p>As she rattles on, about Violet, about Gemma Sterling, about the 
Bartlett Dirt,
 I don’t say
anything else. I suddenly don’t want Bren or Charlie to talk about Violet, because I want to
keep her to myself, like the Christmas I was eight—back when Christmases were still good—
and got my first guitar, which I named No Trespassing, as in no one could touch it but me.</p><p>Finally, though, I have no choice but to interrupt Bren. “She was in that accident last April
with her sister, the one where they drove off the A Street Bridge.”</p><p>“Oh my God. That was her?”</p><p>“Her sister was a senior.”</p><p>“Shit.” Bren cradles her chin in her hand and taps it. “You know, maybe you should play it
a little safer.” Her voice is softer. “Think Ryan Cross. You see how he dresses. We should go
to Old Navy or American Eagle, or better yet, to Abercrombie over in Dayton.”</p><p>Charlie says to Brenda, “She’s never gonna go for him. Doesn’t matter what he wears. No
offense, man.”</p><p>“None taken. And fuck Ryan Cross.” I use that word for the first time in my life. It feels so
liberating that I suddenly feel like running around the store. “Fuck him.” I decide the new
Finch swears whenever and however he wants to. He’s the kind of Finch who would stand on
a building and think about jumping just because nothing scares him. He is seriously badass.</p><p>“In that case.” Charlie yanks a jacket off its hanger and holds it up. It’s pretty badass too.
All scuffed, worn-out leather, like something Keith Richards might have worn way, way back
in the day.</p><p>It’s pretty much the coolest jacket I’ve ever seen. I’m pulling it on as Bren sighs, walks
away, and comes strolling back with a giant pair of black Beatles boots. “They’re size
fourteen,” she says. “But the way you grow, you’ll fill them out by Friday.”</p><p>By lunch, I’m starting to dig Badass Finch. For one thing, girls seem to like him. A cute
underclassman actually stops me in the hall and asks if I need help finding my way. She must
be a freshman, because it’s clear she has no idea who I am. When she wants to know if I’m
from London, I say 
cheers
 and 
aye up
 and 
hangers and mash,
 in what I think is a pretty
convincing accent. She alternately giggles and flips her hair as she guides me to the cafeteria.</p><p>Because BHS has some two thousand students, they have us divided into three different
lunch periods. Brenda skips class today to eat with Charlie and me, and I greet them with a
cheerio
 and 
’ello, mates,
 and 
you’re the dog’s bollocks,
 and such. Bren just blinks at me, then
blinks at Charlie. “Please tell me he’s not British.” He shrugs and keeps eating.</p><p>I spend the rest of lunch hour talking to them about my favorite spots back home—Honest
Jon’s, Rough Trade East, and Out on the Floor, the record shops I hang out in. I tell them
about my mean but sexy Irish girlfriend, Fiona, and my best blokes, Tam and Natz. By the
time lunch is through, I’ve created a universe I can see down to the last detail—the Sex
Pistols and Joy Division posters on my wall, the fags I smoke out the window of the flat Fiona
and I share, the nights spent playing music at the Hope and Anchor and the Halfmoon, the
days devoted to cutting records at Abbey Road studios. When the bell rings and Charlie says,
“Let’s go, you todger,” I feel homesick for this London I left behind.</p>

        <p>Yes, sir.
 As I walk through the halls, there’s no telling what Badass British Finch might do.
Take over the school, take over the town, take over the world. It will be a world of
compassion, of neighbor loving neighbor, of student loving student or at least treating one
another with respect. No judgments. No name-calling. No more, no more, no more.</p><p>By the time I get to U.S. Geography, I’ve almost convinced myself this world exists. Until I
see Ryan Cross, all gold, flowing, his hand on the back of Violet’s chair as if he’s the host at
the Macaroni Grill. He is smiling at her and talking, and she is smiling at him with her mouth
closed, gray-green eyes wide and serious behind her glasses, and just like that, I am Indiana-
born Theodore Finch in a pair of secondhand boots. Guys like Ryan Cross have a way of
reminding you who you are, even when you don’t want to remember.</p><p>As I try to catch Violet’s eye, she’s too busy nodding and listening to Ryan, and then
Roamer is there and Amanda Monk, who fixes me with a death glare and snaps, “What are
you looking at?” Then Violet is swallowed by them, so all I can do is stare in the direction of
where she once was.</p><p>Mr. Black wheezes to the front of the room as the bell rings and asks if anyone has
questions about the project. Hands go up, and one by one he addresses the concerns. “Get out
there and see ... your state. Go to museums ... and parks ... and historic sites. Get
yourselves ... some culture ... so that when you do leave ... you can take it with you.”</p><p>In my very best British, I say, “But I thought you can’t take it with you.”</p><p>Violet laughs. She is the only one. As soon as she does, she turns away from everyone and
stares at the wall beside her right shoulder.</p><p>When the bell rings, I walk past Ryan Cross and Roamer and Amanda until I’m standing so
close to Violet that I can smell her flower shampoo. The thing about Badass Finch is that guys
like Ryan Cross don’t intimidate him for long.</p><p>Amanda says, “Can we help you?” in her nasally little-girl voice.</p><p>In my regular, non-British accent I say to Violet, “It’s time to start wandering.”</p><p>“Where?” Her eyes are cold and a little wary, as if she’s afraid I might out her right here,
right now.</p><p>“Have you been to Hoosier Hill?”</p><p>“No.” ’</p><p>“It’s the highest point in the state.”</p><p>“I’ve heard.”</p><p>“I thought you might like it. Unless you have a fear of heights.” I cock my head.</p><p>Her face goes blank and then she recovers, the corners of her perfect mouth turning up in a
perfect fake smile. “No. I’m okay with them.”</p><p>“She saved you from jumping off that ledge, didn’t she?” This is from Amanda. She waves
her phone, where I can just make out the headline from the 
Bartlett Dirt.</p><p>Roamer mumbles, “Maybe you should go back up there and try again.”</p><p>“And miss the opportunity to see Indiana? No thanks.” Their eyes bore into me as I look at
Violet. “Let’s go.”</p><p>“Right now?”</p><p>“No time like the present, and all that. You of all people should know we’re only
guaranteed right now.”</p><p>Roamer says, “Hey, asshole, why don’t you ask her boyfriend?”</p>

        <p>I say to Roamer, “Because I’m not interested in Ryan, I’m interested in Violet.” I say to
Ryan, “It’s not a date, man. It’s a project.”</p><p>“He’s not my boyfriend,” Violet says, and Ryan looks so hurt that I almost feel bad for him,
except that it’s impossible to feel bad for a guy like him. “I can’t skip class.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Because I’m not a delinquent.” Her tone is clear
—not like you
—and I tell myself she’s only
putting it on for the crowd.</p><p>“I’ll wait for you in the parking lot after school.” On the way out, I pause. “ ‘Come,’ I say,
‘come.’ ”</p><p>It might be my imagination, but she almost smiles.</p><p>“Freak,” I hear Amanda mutter as I walk out. I accidentally whack my elbow against the
doorframe, and, for good luck, whack the other.</p>
