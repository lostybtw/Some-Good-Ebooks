  <body dir="auto"><h1>FINCH</h1><h2>Day 28</h2><p>John Ivers is a polite, soft-spoken grandfather with a white baseball cap and a mustache. He
and the missus live on a large farm way out in the Indiana countryside. Thanks to a website
called Unusual Indiana, I have his telephone number. I’ve called ahead, just like the site said
to do, and John is in the yard waiting for us. He waves and walks forward, shaking hands and
apologizing that Sharon’s gone off to the market.</p><p>He leads us to the roller coaster he’s built in his backyard—actually there are two: the Blue
Flash and the Blue Too. Each seats one person, which is the only disappointing thing about it,
but otherwise it’s really damn cool. John says, “I’m not engineer educated, but I am an
adrenaline junkie. Demolition derbies, drag racing, driving fast—when I gave them up, I tried
to think of something I could do to replace them, something that would give me that rush. I
love the thrill of impending, weightless doom, so I built something to give me those feelings
all the time.”</p><p>As he stands, hands on hips, nodding at the Blue Flash, I think about 
impending
, 
weighdess
doom.
 It’s a phrase I like and understand. I tuck it away in the corner of my mind to pull out
later, maybe for a song.</p><p>I say, “You may be the most brilliant man I have ever met.” I like the idea of something
that can give you those feelings all the time. I want something like that, and then I look at
Violet and think: 
There she is.</p><p>John Ivers has built the roller coaster into the side of a shed. He says it measures 180 feet
in length and climbs to a height of 20 feet. The speeds don’t get above 25 mph, and it only
lasts ten seconds, but there’s an upside-down loop in the middle. To look at it, the Flash is
just twisted scrap metal painted baby blue, with a 1970s bucket seat and a frayed cloth lap
belt, but something about it makes my palms itch and I can’t wait to ride.</p><p>I tell Violet she can go first. “No. That’s okay. You go.” She backs away from the roller
coaster like it might reach out and swallow her, and I suddenly wonder if this whole thing
was a bad idea.</p><p>Before I can open my mouth to say anything, John straps me into the seat and pushes me
up the side of the shed till I feel and hear a click, and then up, up, up I go. He says, “You
might want to hold on, son,” as I reach the top, and so I do as I hover, just for a second, at the
very top of the shed, farmland spread out around me, and then off I shoot, down and into the
loop, shouting myself hoarse. Too soon, it’s over, and I want to go again, because this is what
life should feel like all the time, not just for ten seconds.</p><p>I do this five more times because Violet still isn’t ready, and whenever I get to the end, she
waves her hands and says, “Do it again.”</p><p>The next time I come to rest, I climb out, legs shaking, and suddenly Violet is taking a seat</p>

        </div>
        <p>and John Ivers is strapping her in, and then she’s climbing, up to the top, where she hovers.
She turns her head to look in my direction, but suddenly she’s off and diving and swooping
and yelling her head off.</p><p>When she comes to a stop, I can’t tell if she’s going to throw up or climb out and slap me.
Instead, she shouts, “Again!” And she’s off once more in a blur of blue metal and long hair
and long legs and arms.</p><p>We trade places then, and I go three times in a row, till the world looks upside down and
tilted and I feel the blood pumping hard in my veins. As he unbuckles the lap belt, John Ivers
chuckles. “That’s a lot of ride.”</p><p>“You can say that again.” I reach for Violet because I’m not too steady on my feet and it’s a
long way down if I fall. She wraps her arm around me like it’s second nature, and I lean into
her and she leans into me until we make up one leaning person.</p><p>“Want to try the Blue Too?” John wants to know, and suddenly I don’t because I want to be
alone with this girl. But Violet breaks free and goes right to the roller coaster and lets John
strap her in.</p><p>The Blue Too isn’t nearly so fun, so we ride the Flash twice more. When I step off for the
last time, I take Violet’s hand and she swings it back and forth, back and forth. Tomorrow I’ll
be at my dad’s for Sunday dinner, but today I’m here.</p><p>The things we leave behind are a miniature toy car we got at the dollar store—symbolizing
Little Bastard—and two dollhouse figures, a boy and a girl, which we tuck inside an empty
pack of American Spirit cigarettes. We cram it all into a magnetized tin the size of an index
card.</p><p>“So that’s it,” Violet says, sticking it to the underside of the Blue Flash. “Our last
wandering.”</p><p>“I don’t know. As fun as this was, I’m not sure it’s what Black had in mind. I’ll need to
ruminate on it, understand—give it some good, hard thought—but we may need to choose a
kind of backup place, just in case. The last thing I want to do is half-ass this, especially now
that we have the support of your parents.”</p><p>On the way home, she rolls down the window, her hair blowing wild. The pages of our
wandering notebook rattle in the breeze as she writes, head bent, one leg crossed over the
other to make a kind of table. When she’s like this for a few miles, I say, “What are you
working on?”</p><p>“Just making some notes. First I was writing about the Blue Flash, and then about a man
who builds a roller coaster in his backyard. But then I had a couple of ideas I wanted to get
on paper.” Before I can ask about these ideas, her head is bent over the notebook again, and
the pen is scratching across the page.</p><p>When she looks up again two miles later, she says, “You know what I like about you,
Finch? You’re interesting. You’re different. And I can talk to you. Don’t let that go to your
head.”</p><p>The air around us feels charged and electric, like if you were to strike a match, the air, the
car, Violet, me—everything might just explode. I keep my eyes on the road. “You know what
I like about you, Ultraviolet Remarkey-able? Everything.”</p><p>“But I thought you didn’t like me.”</p><p>And then I look at her. She raises an eyebrow at me.</p>

        <p>I go careering off onto the first exit I see. We roll past the gas station and the fast-food
joints and bump across the median into a parking lot. 
east township public library, 
the sign says. I
wrench Little Bastard into park and then I get out and walk around to her side.</p><p>When I open the door, she says, “What the hell is going on?”</p><p>“I can’t wait. I thought I could, but I can’t. Sorry.” I reach across her and unsnap her seat
belt, then pull her out so we’re standing face to face in this flat, ugly parking lot next to a
dark library, a Chick-fil-A right next door. I can hear the drivethrough cashier on the speaker
asking if they want to add fries and a drink.</p><p>“Finch?”</p><p>I brush a loose strand of hair off her cheek. Then I hold her face in my hands and kiss her. I
kiss her harder than I mean to, so I ease off a little, but then she’s kissing me back. Her arms
are around my neck, and I’m up against her, and she’s against the car, and then I pick her up,
and her legs are around me, and I somehow get the back door open, and then I’m laying her
down on the blanket that’s there, and I close the doors and yank off my sweater, and she pulls
off her shirt, and I say, “You are driving me crazy. You have been driving me crazy for
weeks.”</p><p>My mouth is on her neck, and she’s making these gasping sounds, and then she says, “Oh
my God, where 
are
 we?” And she’s laughing, and I’m laughing, and she’s kissing my neck,
and my entire body feels like it’s going to fucking explode, and her skin is smooth and warm,
and I run my hand over the curve of her hip as she bites my ear, and then that hand is sliding
into the hollow between her stomach and her jeans. She holds on to me tighter, and when I
start undoing my belt, she kind of pulls away, and I want to bang my head against the wall of
Little Bastard because, shit. 
She’s a virgin.
 I can tell by the pull-away.</p><p>She whispers, “I’m sorry.”</p><p>“All that time with Ryan?”</p><p>“Close, but no.”</p><p>I run my fingers up and down her stomach. “Seriously.”</p><p>“Why’s it so hard to believe?”</p><p>“Because it’s Ryan Cross. I thought girls lost it just by looking at him.”</p><p>She slaps my arm and then lays her hand on top of mine and says, “This is the last thing I
thought would happen today.”</p><p>“Thanks.”</p><p>“You know what I meant.”</p><p>I pick up her shirt, hand it to her, pick up my sweater. As I watch her get dressed, I say,
“Someday, Ultraviolet,” and she actually looks disappointed.</p><p>At home in my room, I am overcome by words. Words for songs. Words of places Violet and I
will go before time runs out and I’m asleep again. I can’t stop writing. I don’t want to stop
even if I could.</p><p>January 31. Method: None. On a scale of one to ten on the how-close-did-l-come
scale: zero. Facts: The Euthanasia Coaster doesn’t actually exist. But if it did, it would
be a three-minute ride that involves a climb nearly a third of a mile long, up to 1,600 feet,
followed by a sheer drop and seven loops. That final descent and series of loops takes
sixty seconds, but the 10 G centrifugal force that results from the 223-mile-per-hour</p>

        <img src="images/img_0101.png" alt="Picture #101"/>
        </div>
        <p>loops is what kills you.</p><p>And then there is this strange fold in time, and I realize I’m not writing anymore. I’m
running. I’m still wearing the black sweater and old blue jeans and sneakers and gloves, and
suddenly my feet hurt, and somehow I’ve made it all the way to Centerville, which is the next
town over.</p><p>I take off my shoes and pull off my hat, and I walk all the way back home because for once
I’ve worn myself out. But I feel good—necessary and tired and alive.</p><p>Julijonas Urbonas, the man who thought up the Euthanasia Coaster
; 
claims it’s engineered to
“humanely—with elegance and euphoria—take the life of a human being. ” Those 10 Gs create
enough centrifugal force on the body so that the blood rushes down instead of up to the brain
, 
which
results in something called cerebral hypoxia, and this is what kills you.</p><p>I walk through the black Indiana night, under a ceiling of stars, and think about the phrase
“elegance and euphoria,” and how it describes exactly what I feel with Violet.</p><p>For once, I don’t want to be anyone but Theodore Finch, the boy she sees. He understands
what it is to be elegant and euphoric and a hundred different people, most of them flawed
and stupid, part asshole, part screwup, part freak, a boy who wants to be easy for the folks
around him so that he doesn’t worry them and, most of all, easy for himself. A boy who
belongs—here in the world, here in his own skin. He is exactly who I want to be and what I
want my epitaph to say: 
The Boy Violet Markey Loves.</p>
