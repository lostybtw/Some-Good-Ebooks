  <body dir="auto"><h1>VIOLET</h1><p>152 days till graduation</p><p>Sunday morning. My bedroom.</p><p>The EleanorandViolet.com domain name is expiring. I know this because the hosting
company has sent me an email with a warning that says I must renew now or let it go forever.
On my laptop, I open our folders of notes and sort through all the ideas we were working on
before last April. But they’re only fragments that don’t make sense without Eleanor here to
help me decipher her shorthand.</p><p>The two of us had different views on what we wanted the magazine to be. Eleanor was
older (and bossier), which meant she was usually in charge and usually got her way. I can try
to salvage the site, maybe revamp it and turn it into something else—a place where writers
can share their work. A place that isn’t about just nail polish and boys and music, but other
things too, like how to change a tire or how to speak French or what to expect once you get
out into the world.</p><p>I write these things down. Then I go onto the site itself and read the last post, written the
day before the party—two opposite takes on the book 
Julie Plum, Girl Exorcist
 Not even 
The
Bell Jar
 or 
Catcher in the Rye.
 Nothing important or earth-shattering. Nothing that says: 
This is
the last thing you will ever write before the world changes.</p><p>I delete her notes and mine. I delete the hosting company email. And then I empty my trash
so that the email is as dead and gone as Eleanor.</p>
