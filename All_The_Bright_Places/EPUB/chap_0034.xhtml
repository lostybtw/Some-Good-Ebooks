  <body dir="auto"><h1>VIOLET</h1><h2>February 2</h2><p>Mrs. Kresney folds her hands and smiles her too-broad smile. “How are you, Violet?”
“I’m fine, and you?”</p><p>“I’m fine. Let’s talk about you. I want to know how you’re feeling.”</p><p>“I’m good actually. Better than I’ve been in a long time.”</p><p>“Really?” She’s surprised.</p><p>“Yes. I’ve even started writing again. And riding in a car.”</p><p>“How are you sleeping?”</p><p>“Pretty well, I think.”</p><p>“Any bad dreams?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Not even one?”</p><p>“Not in a while now.”</p><p>For the first time, it’s the truth.</p><p>In Russian lit, Mrs. Mahone assigns us a five-page paper on Turgenev’s 
Fathers and Sons.
 She
looks at me, and I don’t mention anything about Extenuating Circumstances or not being
ready. I copy down the notes like everyone else. Afterward, Ryan says, “Can I talk to you?”</p><p>Mrs. Mahone watches as I walk on by her. I give her a wave. “What’s up?” I say to Ryan.</p><p>We go out into the hallway and are swept along with the sea of people. Ryan takes my
hand so he doesn’t lose me, and I’m like, 
Oh God.
 But then there’s a little break in the crowd
and he lets go. “Where are you headed next?”</p><p>“Lunch.”</p><p>We walk together, and Ryan says, “So I just wanted to let you know that I asked Suze out. I
thought you should hear it from me before it got all over school.”</p><p>“That’s great.” I almost say something about Finch, but then I’m not sure what to say
because I don’t know what we are or if we’re anything. “Thanks for telling me. I hope Suze
knows what a good guy you are.”</p><p>He nods, gives me his signature smile—I can see the dimple—and then says, “I don’t know
if you heard, but Roamer went after Finch today in gym.”</p><p>“What do you mean ‘went after’?”</p><p>“Whatever. Banged him up a little. Roamer’s an asshole.”</p><p>“What happened? Like, to them? Did they get expelled?”</p><p>“I don’t think so. It was Kappel’s class, and he’s not going to report Roamer and risk losing
him for practice. I gotta go.” A few steps away, he turns. “Finch didn’t even try to defend</p>

        <p>himself. He just stood there and took it.”</p><p>In the cafeteria, I walk past my regular table, past Amanda and Roamer and the audience
gathered there. I can hear Roamer talking, but I can’t hear what he’s saying.</p><p>I walk to the other side of the room, toward a half-empty table, but then behind me I hear
my name. Brenda Shank-Kravitz is sitting with the three Brianas and a dark-haired girl named
Lara at a round table by the window.</p><p>“Hey,” I say. “Do you mind if I join you?” I feel like I’m the new girl again, trying to make
friends and figure out where I fit.</p><p>Brenda picks up her backpack and sweater and keys and phone and all the other things that
are spilled across the table and dumps them onto the floor. I set my tray down and sit next to
her.</p><p>Lara is so small, she looks like a freshman, even though I know we’re in the same class. She
is telling the story of how, just five minutes ago, she accidentally, without meaning to, told
her crush she loved him. Instead of crawling under the table, she just laughs and keeps
eating.</p><p>Then the Brianas are talking about life after high school—one is a musician, one is planning
to be a copy editor, and the other is practically engaged to her longtime boyfriend. She says
she might run a cookie shop one day or write book reviews, but whatever she does, she’s
going to enjoy everything she can while she can. The boyfriend joins us, and the two of them
sit side by side looking comfortable and happy and like they really might be together forever.</p><p>I eat and listen, and at some point Brenda leans over and says in my ear, “Gabe Romero is
poison.” I raise my water bottle and she raises her soda can. We tap them together and drink.</p>
