  <body dir="auto"><h1>FINCH</h1><h2>The first warm day</h2><p>The second week of February there’s a blizzard that leaves the entire town without power for
two days. The best thing about it is that school is canceled, but the worst thing is that the
snow is so high and the air so bitter cold, you can barely stay out in it for more than five
minutes at a time. I tell myself it’s only water in a different form, and I walk all the way to
Violet’s, where we build the world’s largest snowman. We name him Mr. Black and decide
he’ll be a destination for others to see when they’re wandering. Afterward, we sit with her
parents around the fire and I pretend I’m part of the family.</p><p>Once the roads are clear, Violet and I creep very, very carefully down them to see the
Painted Rainbow Bridge, the Periodic Table Display, the Seven Pillars, and the lynching and
burial site of the Reno brothers, America’s first train robbers. We climb the sheer, high walls
of Empire Quarry, where they got the 18,630 tons of stone needed to build the Empire State
Building. We visit the Indiana Moon Tree, which is a giant sycamore more than thirty years
old that grew from a seed taken to the moon and brought back. This tree is nature’s rock star
because it’s one of only fifty left alive from an original set of five hundred.</p><p>We go to Kokomo to hear the hum in the air, and we park Little Bastard in neutral at the
base of Gravity Hill and roll to the top. It is like the world’s slowest roller coaster, but
somehow it works, and minutes later we’re at the peak. Afterward, I take her out for a
Valentine’s Day dinner at my favorite restaurant, Happy Family, which sits at the end of a
strip mall about fifteen miles from home. It serves the best Chinese food east of the
Mississippi.</p><p>The first warm day falls on a Saturday, which is how we end up in Prairieton at the Blue
Hole, a three-acre lake that sits on private property. I collect our offerings—the stubs of her
SAT number 2 pencils and four broken guitar strings. The air is so warm, we don’t even need
jackets, just sweaters, and after the winter we’ve been through so far, it feels almost tropical.</p><p>I hold out my hand and lead her up the embankment and down the hill to a wide, round
pool of blue water, ringed by trees. It’s so private and silent that I pretend we’re the only two
people on earth, which is how I wish it could be for real.</p><p>“Okay,” she says, letting out a long breath, as if she’s been holding it all this time. The
goggles hang around her neck. “What is this place?”</p><p>“This,” I say, “is the Blue Hole. They say it’s bottomless, or that the bottom is quicksand.
They say there’s a force in the middle of the lake that sucks you down into an underground
river that flows right into the Wabash. They say it leads you to another world. That it was a
hiding place for pirates burying treasure, and for Chicago bootleggers burying bodies and
dumping stolen cars. That in the 1950s a group of teenage boys went swimming here and</p>

        </div>
        <p>disappeared. In 1969, two sheriffs deputies launched an expedition to explore the Hole, but
they didn’t find any cars or treasure or bodies. They also didn’t find the bottom. What they
did find was a whirlpool that nearly sucked them down.”</p><p>I’ve ditched the red cap, gloves, and black sweater, and am wearing a navy pullover and
jeans. I’ve cut my hair shorter, and when she first saw me, Violet said, “All-American Finch.
Okay.” Now I kick off my shoes and yank off the shirt. It’s almost hot in the sun, and I want
to go swimming. “Bottomless blue holes exist all over the world, and each one has these kinds
of myths associated with it. They were formed as caverns, thousands of years ago during the
last ice age. They’re like black holes on earth, places where nothing can escape and time and
space come to an end. How bloody awesome is it that we actually have one of our own?”</p><p>She glances back toward the house and the car and the road, then smiles up at me. “Pretty
awesome.” She kicks off her shoes and pulls off her shirt and pants so that, in seconds, she is
standing there in only her bra and underwear, which are a kind of dull rose color but
somehow the sexiest things I’ve ever seen.</p><p>I go totally and utterly speechless and she starts to laugh. “Well, come on. I know you’re
not shy, so drop your pants and let’s do this. I assume you want to see if the rumors are true.”
My mind draws a blank, and she juts one hip out, Amanda Monk-style, resting a hand on it.
“About it being bottomless?”</p><p>“Oh yeah. Right. Of course.” I slide off my jeans so I’m in my boxers, and I take her hand.
We walk to the rock ledge that surrounds part of the Hole and climb up onto it. “What are
you most afraid of?” I say before we jump. I can already feel my skin starting to burn from
the sun.</p><p>“Dying. Losing my parents. Staying here for the rest of my life. Never figuring out what I’m
supposed to do. Being ordinary. Losing everyone I love.” I wonder if I’m included in that
group. She is bouncing on the balls of her feet, as if she’s cold. I try not to stare at her chest
as she does because, whatever else he is, All-American Finch is not a perv. “What about you?”
she asks. She fits the goggles into place. “What are you most afraid of?”</p><p>I think, 
I’m most afraid of
 
Just be careful. 
I’m most afraid of the Long Drop. I’m most afraid of
Asleep and
 
impending, weightless doom. 
I’m most afraid of me.</p><p>“I’m not.” I take her hand, and together we leap through the air. And in that moment
there’s nothing I fear except losing hold of her hand. The water is surprisingly warm and,
below the surface, strangely clear and, well, blue. I look at her, hoping her eyes are open, and
they are. With my free hand, I point below, and she nods, her hair fanning out like seaweed.
Together, we swim, still linked, like a person with three arms.</p><p>We head down, where the bottom would be if there was one. The deeper we go, the darker
the blue becomes. The water feels darker too, as if the weight of it has settled. It’s only when
I feel her tug at my hand that I let myself be pulled back up to the surface, where we break
out of the water and fill our lungs. “Jesus,” she says. “You can hold your breath.”</p><p>“I practice,” I say, suddenly wishing I hadn’t said it at all, because it’s one of those things—
like 
I am make-believe
—that sounds better in my own head.</p><p>She just smiles and splashes me, and I splash her back. We do this for a while, and I chase
her around the surface, ducking under, grabbing her legs. She slips through my grasp and
breaks into a breaststroke, clean and strong. I remind myself that she’s a California girl and
probably grew up swimming in the ocean. I suddenly feel jealous of all the years she had</p>

        </div>
        <p>before meeting me, and then I swim after her. We tread water, looking at each other, and
suddenly there’s not enough water in the world to clean away my dirty thoughts.</p><p>She says, “I’m glad we came.”</p><p>We float on our backs, holding hands again, faces to the sun. Because my eyes are closed, I
whisper, “Marco.”</p><p>“Polo,” she answers, and her voice sounds lazy and far away.</p><p>After a while, I say, “Do you want to go look for the bottom again?”</p><p>“No. I like it here, just like this.” Then she asks, “When did the divorce happen?”</p><p>“Around this time last year.”</p><p>“Did you know it was coming?”</p><p>“I did and I didn’t.”</p><p>“Do you like your stepmother?”</p><p>“She’s fine. She has a seven-year-old son who may or may not be my dad’s, because I’m
pretty sure he was cheating with her for the past few years. He left us once, when I was ten or
eleven, said he couldn’t deal with us anymore. I think he was with her then. He came back,
but when he left for good, he made it clear it was our fault. Our fault he came back, our fault
he had to leave. He just couldn’t have a family.”</p><p>“And then he married a woman with a kid. What’s he like?”</p><p>The son I will never be.
 
“He’s just a kid.” I don’t want to talk about Josh Raymond. “I’m
going in search of the bottom. Are you okay here? Do you mind?”</p><p>“I’m good. You go. I’ll be here.” She floats away.</p><p>I take a breath and dive, grateful for the dark of the water and the warmth against my skin.
I swim to get away from Josh Raymond, and my cheating father, and Violet’s involved
parents who are also her friends, and my sad, deserted mother, and my bones. I close my eyes
and pretend it’s Violet who surrounds me instead, and then I open my eyes and push myself
down, one arm out like Superman.</p><p>I feel the strain of my lungs wanting air, but I keep going. It feels a lot like the strain of
trying to stay awake when I can feel the darkness sliding under my skin, trying to borrow my
body without asking so that my hands become its hands, my legs its legs.</p><p>I dive deeper, lungs tight and burning. I feel a distant twinge of panic, but I make my mind
go quiet before I send my body deeper. I want to see how far I can go. 
She’s waiting for me.
The thought fills me, but I can still feel the darkness working its way up, through my fingers,
trying to grab hold.</p><p>Less than 2 percent of people in the U.S. kill themselves by drowning, maybe because the human
body was built to float. The number one country in the world for drowning, accidental or otherwise,
is Russia, which has twice as many deaths as the next highest, Japan. The Cayman Islands,
surrounded by the Caribbean Sea, has the fewest drownings of all.</p><p>I like it deeper, where the water feels heaviest. Water is better than running because it
blocks everything out. Water is my special power, my way to cheat the Asleep and stop it
from coming on.</p><p>I want to go even deeper than this, because the deeper the better. I want to keep going. But
something makes me stop. The thought of Violet. The burning sensation in my lungs. I stare
longingly at the black of where the bottom should be but isn’t, and then I stare up again at
the light, very faint but still there, waiting with Violet, over my head.</p>
        <div style="width: 99.68627450980392%;">
        <img src="images/img_0111.png" alt="Picture #111"/>
        </div>
        <p>It takes strength to push myself up, because I need air by now, badly. The panic comes
back, stronger this time, and then I aim myself for the surface. 
Come on,
 I think. 
Please come
on.
 My body wants up, but it’s tired. 
I’m sorry. I’m sorry
, 
Violet. I won’t leave you again. I don’t
know what I was thinking. I’m coming.</p><p>When I finally hit the air, she is sitting on the bank crying. “Asshole,” she says.</p><p>I feel my smile go and I swim toward her, head up, afraid to put it under again, even for a
second, afraid she’ll freak out.</p><p>“Asshole,” she says, louder this time, standing, still in her underwear. She wraps her arms
around herself, trying to get warm, trying to cover up, trying to pull away from me. “What
the hell? Do you know how scared I was? I searched everywhere. I went as deep as I could
before I ran out of air and had to come back up, like, three times.”</p><p>I want her to say my name because then I’ll know it’s okay and I haven’t gone too far and I
haven’t just lost her forever. But she doesn’t, and I can feel a cold, dark feeling growing in the
pit of my stomach—every bit as cold and dark as the water. I find the outer edge of the Blue
Hole where there’s suddenly a bottom, and I rise up out of it until I’m next to her, dripping on
the bank.</p><p>She pushes me hard and then again, so I go jolting backward, but I don’t lose my footing. I
stand there as she slaps at me, and then she starts to cry, and she is shaking.</p><p>I want to kiss her but I’ve never seen her like this, and I’m not sure what she’ll do if I try to
touch her. I tell myself, 
For once it’s not about you, Finch.
 So I stand an arm’s length away and
say, “Let it out, all that stuff you’re carrying around. You’re pissed off at me, at your parents,
at life, at Eleanor. Come on. Let me have it. Don’t disappear in there.” I mean inside herself,
where I’ll never get to her.</p><p>“Screw you, Finch.”</p><p>“Better. Keep going. Don’t stop now. Don’t be a waiting person. You lived. You survived a
really horrible accident. But you’re just ... there. You’re just 
existing
 like everyone else. Get
up. Do this. Do that. Lather. Rinse. Repeat. Over and over so that you don’t have to think
about it.”</p><p>She shoves me again and again. “Stop acting like you know how I feel.” She’s pounding at
me with her fists, but I just stand, feet planted, and take it.</p><p>“I know there’s more in there, probably years of shit you’ve been smiling away and keeping
down.”</p><p>She pounds and pounds and then suddenly covers her face. “You don’t know how it is. It’s
like I’ve got this angry little person inside me, and I can feel him trying to get out. He’s
running out of room because he’s growing bigger and bigger, and so he starts rising up, into
my lungs, chest, throat, and I just push him right back down. I don’t want him to come out. I
can’t let him out.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Because I hate him, because he’s not me, but he’s in there and he won’t leave me alone,
and all I can think is that I want to go up to someone, anyone, and just knock them into space
because I’m angry at all of them.”</p><p>“So don’t tell me. Break something. Smash something. Throw something. Or scream. Just
get it out of you.” I yell again. I yell and yell. Then I pick up a rock and smash it into the wall
that surrounds the hole.</p>
        <div style="width: 99.68627450980392%;">
        <img src="images/img_0112.png" alt="Picture #112"/>
        </div>
        <p>I hand her a rock and she stands, palm up, like she’s not sure what to do. I take the rock
from her and hurl it against the wall, then hand her another. Now she’s hurling them at the
wall and shouting and stomping, and she looks like a crazy person. We jump up and down the
banks and storm around smashing things, and then she turns on me, all of a sudden, and says,
“What are we, anyway? What exactly is going on here?”</p><p>It’s at that moment that I can’t help myself, even though she is furious, even though she
maybe hates me right now. I pull her in and kiss her the way I’ve always wanted to kiss her, a
lot more R-rated than PG-13. I can feel her tense at first, not wanting to kiss me back, and the
thought of it breaks my heart. Before I can pull away, I feel her bend and then melt into me
as I melt into her under the warm Indiana sun. And she’s still here, and she isn’t going
anywhere, and it will be okay. 
I am carried off. We yield to this slow flood. ...In and out, we are
swept;... we cannot step outside its sinuous, its hesitating, its abrupt, its perfectly encircling walls.</p><p>And then I push her away.</p><p>“What the hell, Finch?” She is wet and angry and staring at me with large gray-green eyes.</p><p>“You deserve better. I can’t promise you I’ll stay around, not because I don’t want to. It’s
hard to explain. I’m a fuckup. I’m broken, and no one can fix it. I’ve tried. I’m still trying. I
can’t love anyone because it’s not fair to anyone who loves me back. I’ll never hurt you, not
like I want to hurt Roamer. But I can’t promise I won’t pick you apart, piece by piece, until
you’re in a thousand pieces, just like me. You should know what you’re getting into before
getting involved.”</p><p>“In case you haven’t noticed, we’re already involved, Finch. And in case you haven’t
noticed, I’m broken too.” Then she says, “Where did you get the scar? The real story this
time.”</p><p>“The real story’s boring. My dad gets in these black moods. Like, the blackest black. Like,
no moon, no stars, storm’s coming black. I used to be a lot smaller than I am now. I used to
not know how to get out of the way.” These are just some of the things I never wanted to say
to her. “I wish I could promise you perfect days and sunshine, but I’m never going to be Ryan
Cross.”</p><p>“If there’s one thing I know, it’s that no one can promise anything. And I don’t want Ryan
Cross. Let me worry about what I want.” And then she kisses me. It’s the kind of kiss that
makes me lose track of everything, and so it may be hours or minutes by the time we break
apart.</p><p>She says, “By the way? Ryan Cross is a kleptomaniac. He steals stuff for fun. And not even
things he wants, but everything. His room looks like one of those rooms on 
Hoarders.
 Just in
case you thought he was perfect.”</p><p>“Ultraviolet Remarkey-able, I think I love you.”</p><p>So that she doesn’t feel she has to say it back, I kiss her again, and wonder if I dare do
anything else, go any further, because I don’t want to ruin this moment. And then, because
I’m now the one thinking too much, and because she is different from all other girls and
because I really, really don’t want to screw this up, I concentrate on kissing her on the banks
of the Blue Hole, in the sunshine, and I let that be enough.</p>
