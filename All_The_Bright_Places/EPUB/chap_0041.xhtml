  <body dir="auto"><h1>FINCH</h1><h2>How to survive quicksand</h2><p>That night, I move into my walk-in closet, which is warm and cozy, like a cave. I push my
hanging clothes to one corner and lay the comforter from my bed on the floor. I set the jug of
Mudlavia healing water at the foot and prop Violet’s picture against the wall—a shot of her at
the Blue Flash—along with the license plate I took from the scene of the accident. Then I turn
off the light. I balance my laptop on my knees and stick a cigarette in my mouth unlit because
the air’s too close in here as it is.</p><p>This is Finch Survival Boot Camp. I’ve been here before and know the drill like the back of
my too-large hand. I will stay in here as long as I need to, as long as it takes.</p><p>The MythBusters say there is no way to drown in quicksand, but tell that to the young mother
who went to Antigua for her father’s wedding (to wife number two) and was sucked into the beach
as she watched the sunset. Or the teenage boys who were swallowed whole by a man-made
quicksand pit on the property of an Illinois businessman.</p><p>Apparently, to survive quicksand, you should stay perfectly still. It’s only when you panic
that you pull yourself under and sink. So maybe if I stay still and follow the Eight Steps to
Surviving Quicksand, I’ll get through this.</p><p>1. 
Avoid quicksand.
 Okay. Too late. Moving on.</p><p>2. 
Bring a large stick when going into quicksand territory.
 The theory here is that you can use
the stick to test the ground in front of you, and even pull yourself out of it if you sink.
The problem with this theory is that you don’t always know when you’re entering
quicksand territory, not until it’s too late. But I like the idea of preparedness. I figure
I’ve just left this step and have gone on to:</p><p>3. 
Drop everything if you find yourself in quicksand.
 If you’re weighed down by something
heavy, you’re apt to get pulled to the bottom faster. You need to shed your shoes and
anything you’re carrying. It’s always best to do this when you know ahead of time that
you’re going to encounter quicksand (see number 2), so, essentially, if you’re going
anywhere that might even possibly have quicksand, go naked. My removal to the closet
is part of the dropping everything.</p><p>4. 
Relax.
 This goes back to the stay-perfectly-still-soyou-don’t-sink adage. Additional fact: if
you relax, your body’s buoyancy will cause you to float. In other words, it’s time to be
calm and let the Jovian-Plutonian gravitational effect take over.</p><p>5. 
Breathe deeply.
 This goes hand in hand with number 4. The trick, apparently, is to keep
as much air in your lungs as possible—the more you breathe, the more you float.</p><p>6. 
Get on your back.
 If you start sinking, you simply fall backward and spread yourself out</p>

        </div>
        <p>as far as you can as you try to pull your legs free. Once you’re unrooted, you can inch
yourself to solid ground and safety.</p><p>7. 
Take your time.
 Wild movements only hurt your cause, so move slowly and carefully
until you’re free again.</p><p>8. 
Take frequent breaks.
 Climbing out of quicksand can be a long process, so be sure to take
breaks when you feel your breath running out or your body beginning to tire. Keep your
head high so that you buy yourself more time.</p>
