  <body dir="auto"><h1>VIOLET</h1><h2>March 18</h2><p>I don’t hear from Finch for a day, then two days, then three days. By the time I get home
from school on Wednesday, it’s snowing. The roads are white, and I’ve wiped out a half dozen
times on Leroy. I find my mom in her office and ask if I can borrow her car.</p><p>It takes her a moment to find her voice. “Where are you going?”</p><p>“To Shelby’s house.” Shelby Padgett lives on the other side of town. I’m amazed at how
easily the words come out of my mouth. I act like the fact that I’m asking if I can drive her
car, when I haven’t driven in a year, is no big deal, but my mom is staring at me. She
continues to stare as she hands me her keys and follows me to the door and down the
sidewalk. And then I can see that she’s not just staring, she’s crying.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she says, wiping at her eyes. “We just weren’t sure ... we didn’t know if we’d
ever see you drive again. The accident changed a lot of things and it took a lot of things. Not
that driving, in the great scheme of life, is so important, but you shouldn’t have to think twice
about it at your age, except to be careful....”</p><p>She’s kind of babbling, but she looks happy, which only makes me feel worse about lying to
her. I hug her before climbing in behind the wheel. I wave and smile and start the engine and
say out loud, “Okay.” I pull away slowly, still waving and smiling but wondering what in the
hell I think I’m doing.</p><p>I’m shaky at first because it’s been so long and I wasn’t sure I’d ever drive again either. I
jerk myself black and blue because I keep hitting the brakes. But then I think of Eleanor
beside me, letting me drive home after I got my license. 
You can drive me everywhere now
, 
little
sister. You’ll he my chauffeur. I’ll sit in the back, put my feet up, and just enjoy the view.</p><p>I look over at the passenger seat and I can almost see her, smiling at me, not even glancing
at the road, as if she doesn’t need to look because she trusts me to know what I’m doing
without her help. I can see her leaning back against the door, knees under her chin, laughing
at something, or singing along with the music. I can almost hear her.</p><p>By the time I get to Finch’s neighborhood, I’m cruising along smoothly, like someone who’s
been driving for years. A woman answers the door, and this must be his mother because her
eyes are the same bright-sky blue as Finch’s. It’s strange to think, after all this time, I’m only
meeting her now.</p><p>I hold out my hand and say, “I’m Violet. It’s nice to meet you. I’ve come to see Finch.” It
occurs to me that maybe she’s never heard of me, so I add, “Violet Markey.”</p><p>She shakes my hand and says, “Of course. Violet. Yes. He should be home from school by
now.” 
She doesn’t know he’s been expelled.
 She is wearing a suit, but she’s in her stocking feet.
There’s a kind of faded, weary prettiness to her. “Come on in. I’m just getting home myself.”</p><p>I follow her into the kitchen. Her purse sits on the breakfast table next to a set of car keys,</p>

        </div>
        <p>and her shoes are on the floor. I hear a television from the other room, and Mrs. Finch calls,
“Decca?”</p><p>In a moment I hear a distant “What?”</p><p>“Just checking.” Mrs. Finch smiles at me and offers me something to drink—water, juice,
soda—as she pours herself a glass of wine from a corked bottle in the fridge. I tell her water’s
fine, and she asks ice or no ice, and I say no ice, even though I like it better cold.</p><p>Kate walks in and waves hello. “Hey.”</p><p>“Hey. I came to see Finch.”</p><p>They chat with me like everything is normal, like he hasn’t been expelled, and Kate pulls
something out of the freezer and sets the temperature on the oven. She tells her mother to
remember to listen for the buzzer and then tugs on her coat. “He’s probably upstairs. You can
go on up.”</p><p>I knock on the door to his room, but don’t get any answer. I knock again. “Finch? It’s me.”</p><p>I hear a shuffling, and the door opens. Finch wears pajama bottoms but no shirt, and
glasses. His hair spikes up in all directions, and I think, 
Nerd Finch.
 He gives me a lopsided
grin and says, “The only person I want to see. My Jovian-Plutonian gravitational effect.” He
moves out of the way so I can come in.</p><p>The room has been stripped bare, down to the sheets on the bed. It looks like a vacant blue
hospital room, waiting to be made up for the next patient. Two medium-sized brown boxes
are stacked by the door.</p><p>My heart does this weird little flip. “It almost looks like—are you moving?”</p><p>“No, I just cleared some things out. Giving a few things to Goodwill.”</p><p>“Are you feeling okay?” I try not to sound like the blaming girlfriend. 
Why won’t you spend
time with me? Why won’t you call me back? Don’t you like me anymore?</p><p>“Sorry, Ultraviolet. I’m still feeling kind of under the weather. Which, when you think
about it, is a very odd expression. One that finds its origins in the sea—as in a sailor or
passenger feels seasick from the storm, and they send him below to get out of the bad
weather.”</p><p>“But you’re better now?”</p><p>“It was touch-and-go for a while, but yeah.” He grins and pulls on a shirt. “Want to see my
fort?”</p><p>“Is that a trick question?”</p><p>“Every man needs a fort, Ultraviolet. A place to let his imagination run wild. A ‘No
Trespassing/No Girls Allowed’ type of space.”</p><p>“If no girls are allowed, why are you letting me see it?”</p><p>“Because you’re not just any girl.”</p><p>He opens the door to his closet, and it actually looks pretty cool. He’s made a kind of cave
for himself, complete with guitar and computer and notebooks of staff paper, along with pens
and stacks of Post-its. My picture is tacked to the blue wall along with a license plate.</p><p>“Other people might call it an office, but I like fort better.”</p><p>He offers me a seat on the blue comforter and we sit side by side, shoulder to shoulder,
backs against the wall. He nods at the opposite wall, and that’s when I see the pieces of paper
there, kind of like his Wall of Ideas, but not as many or as cluttered.</p><p>“So I’ve discovered I think better in here. It gets loud out there sometimes between Decca’s</p>

        <p>music and my mom yelling at my dad over the phone. You’re lucky you live in a house of no
yelling.” He writes down 
House of no yelling
 
and sticks it onto the wall. Then he hands me a
pen and a pad of Post-its. “Want to try?”</p><p>“Just anything?”</p><p>“Anything. Positive ones go on the wall, negative on the floor over there.” He points to this
heap of ripped-up paper. “It’s important to get those down, but they don’t need to hang
around after you do. Words can be bullies. Remember Paula Cleary?” I shake my head. “She
was fifteen when she moved to the States from Ireland and started dating some idiot guy the
other girls loved. They called her ‘slut’ and ‘whore’ and worse and wouldn’t let her alone until
she hanged herself in a stairwell.”</p><p>I write 
Bully
 
and hand it to Finch, who rips it into a hundred pieces and throws it on the
heap. I write 
Mean girls
 
and then shred it to bits. I write 
Accidents, Winter, Ice,
 
and
Bridge,
 
and tear at the paper until it’s only dust.</p><p>Finch scribbles something and slaps it to the wall. 
Welcome.
 
He scribbles something else.
Freak.
 
He shows it to me before destroying it. He writes 
Belong,
 
which goes on the wall, and
Label,
 
which doesn’t. 
Warmth, Saturday, Wander, You, Best friend
 
go up, while 
Cold,
Sunday, Stand still, Everyone else
 
go into the heap.</p><p>Necessary, Loved, Understood, Forgiven
 
are on the wall now, and then I write 
You,
Finch, Theodore, Theo, Theodore Finch,
 
and post them up.</p><p>We do this for a long time, and then he shows me how he makes a song out of the words.
First he rearranges them into a kind of order that almost makes sense. He grabs the guitar and
strums out a tune and, just like that, starts singing. He manages to get every word in, and
afterward I clap and he bows with the top half of his body since he’s still sitting on the floor,
and I say, “You have to write it down. Don’t lose it.”</p><p>“I don’t ever write songs down.”</p><p>“What’s all that staff paper there?”</p><p>“Ideas for songs. Random notes. Things that’ll become songs. Things I might write about
someday, or started once but didn’t finish because there wasn’t enough in them. If a song’s
meant to stay around, you carry it with you in your bones.”</p><p>He writes 
I, want, to, have, sex, with, Ultraviolet, Remarkey-able.</p><p>I write 
Maybe,
 
which he immediately rips up.</p><p>And then I write 
Okay.</p><p>He rips this up too.</p><p>Yes!</p><p>He slaps this onto the wall and then kisses me, his arm circling my waist. Before I know it,
I’m on my back and he’s looking down at me, and I am pulling off his shirt. Then his skin is
on mine, and I’m on top of him, and for a while I forget we’re on the floor of a closet because
all I can think of is him, us, him and me, Finch and Violet, Violet and Finch, and everything is
okay again.</p><p>Afterward, I stare up at the ceiling, and when I look over at him, there is this strange look
on his face. “Finch?” His eyes are fixed on something above us. I poke him in the ribs.
“Finch!”</p><p>Finally his eyes turn to mine and he says, “Hey,” like he just remembered that I’m there. He
sits up and rubs his face with his hands, and then he reaches for the Post-its. He writes 
Relax.</p>

        <p>Then 
Breathe deeply.
 Then 
Violet is life.</p><p>He fixes them to the wall and reaches for the guitar again. I rest my head against his as he
plays, changing the chords a little, but I can’t shake this feeling that something happened, like
he went away for a minute and only part of him came back.</p><p>“Don’t tell anyone about my fort, okay, Ultraviolet?”</p><p>“Like not telling your family you got expelled?”</p><p>He writes 
Guilty
 and holds it up before ripping it into pieces.</p><p>“Okay.” Then I write 
Trust, Promise, Secret, Safe,
 and place them on the wall.</p><p>“Ahhhhh, and now I have to start over.” He closes his eyes, then plays the song again,
adding in the words. It sounds sad the second time, as if he shifted to a minor key.</p><p>“I like your secret fort, Theodore Finch.” This time I rest my head on his shoulder, looking
at the words we’ve written and the song we’ve created, and then at the license plate again. I
feel this strange need to move closer to him, as if he might get away from me. I lay one hand
on his leg.</p><p>In a minute he says, “I get into these moods sometimes, and I can’t shake them.” He’s still
strumming the guitar, still smiling, but his voice has gone serious. “Kind of black, sinking
moods. I imagine it’s what being in the eye of a tornado would be like, all calm and blinding
at the same time. I hate them.”</p><p>I lace my fingers through his so that he has to stop playing. “I get moody too. It’s normal.
It’s what we’re supposed to do. I mean, we’re teenagers.” Just to prove it, I write 
Bad mood
before tearing it up.</p><p>“When I was a kid, younger than Decca, there was this cardinal in our backyard that kept
flying into the sliding glass doors of our house, over and over again until he knocked himself
out. Each time, I thought he was dead, but then he’d get up again and fly off. This little
female cardinal sat and watched him from one of the trees, and I always thought it was his
wife. Anyway, I begged my parents to stop him from banging into the glass. I thought he
should come inside and live with us. Kate called the Audubon Society, and the man there said
if it was his guess, the cardinal was probably just trying to get back to his tree, the one that
had been standing there before someone came along and knocked it down and built a house
on top of it.”</p><p>He tells me about the day the cardinal died, about finding the body on the back deck, about
burying him in the mud nest. “There was nothing to make him last a long time,” Finch told
his parents afterward. He said he always blamed them because he knew they could have been
the thing that made the cardinal last if they’d only let it in like he’d asked them to.</p><p>“That was the first black mood. I don’t remember much that happened after that, not for a
little while at least.”</p><p>The worried feeling is back. “Have you ever talked to anyone? Do your parents or Kate—or
maybe one of the counselors ...?”</p><p>“Parents, no. Kate, not really. I’ve been talking to a counselor at school.”</p><p>I look around the closet, at the comforter we’re sitting on, at the pillows, the water jug, the
energy bars, and that’s when it hits me. “Finch, are you living in here?”</p><p>“I’ve been in here before. Eventually, it works. I’ll wake up one morning and feel like
coming out.” He smiles at me, and the smile seems hollow. “I kept your secret; you keep
mine.”</p>

        </div>
        <p>When I get home, I open the door to my closet and walk inside. It’s larger than Finch’s but
packed full of clothes, shoes, purses, jackets. I try to imagine what it would be like to live in
here and feel I couldn’t come out. I lie down flat and stare up at the ceiling. The floor is hard
and cold. In my head, I write: 
There was a hoy who lived in a closet...
 But that’s as far as I get.</p><p>I’m not claustrophobic, but when I open the door and walk back into my room, I feel like I
can breathe again.</p><p>At dinner, my mom says, “Did you have a fun time with Shelby?” She raises her eyebrows
at my dad. “Violet drove to Shelby’s house after school. As in drove.”</p><p>My dad clinks his glass against mine. “Proud of you, V. Maybe it’s time we talk about
getting you a car of your own.”</p><p>They’re so excited over this that I feel even guiltier about lying. I wonder what they’d do if
I told them where I really was—having sex with the boy they don’t want me to see in the
closet where he’s living.</p>
