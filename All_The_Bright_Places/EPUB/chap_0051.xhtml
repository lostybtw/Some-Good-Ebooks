  <body dir="auto"><h1>VIOLET</h1><h2>March 20</h2><p>After U.S. Geography, Amanda tells Roamer to go on ahead and she’ll catch up. I haven’t
spoken a word to him since Finch got expelled. “I need to tell you something,” she says to me.</p><p>“What?” I haven’t said much to her either.</p><p>“You can’t tell anyone.”</p><p>“Amanda, I’m going to be late for class.”</p><p>“Promise first.”</p><p>“Fine, I promise.”</p><p>She’s talking so low I almost can’t hear her. “I saw Finch at this group I go to. I’ve been
going a while, even though I don’t really need to, but my mom is, like, making me.” She
sighs.</p><p>“What’s the group?”</p><p>“It’s called Life Is Life. It’s this—it’s a support group for teenagers who’ve either thought
about suicide or tried it.”</p><p>“And you saw Finch there? When?”</p><p>“Sunday. He said he was there because he swallowed a bunch of pills and had to go to the
hospital. I thought you should know.”</p><p>I stay through last period, only because I have a test. Afterward, I grab Leroy and ride
directly to Finch’s house. He doesn’t know I’m coming, and when I get there, no one answers
the door. I find some pebbles in the driveway and throw them at his window, and with every
ping ping
 against the glass, my heart jumps. Then I sit down on the front step, hoping his mom
or his sisters will appear and let me in. I’m still sitting there twenty minutes later, the house
as closed up and silent as when I arrived, and finally I head home.</p><p>In my room, I don’t even bother taking off my coat and scarf. I open my laptop and send
Finch a Facebook message. He answers right away, like he’s been waiting. 
So tomorrow’s my
birthday....</p><p>I want to ask where he was and was he there the whole time and did he know that I was
outside his house. I want to ask about the hospital, but I’m worried if I ask anything he’ll go
quiet and disappear, so instead I write: 
How should we celebrate?</p><p>Finch: 
It’s a surprise.</p><p>Me: 
But it’s your birthday, not mine.</p><p>Finch: 
Doesn’t matter. Come over at six. Be hungry.</p>
