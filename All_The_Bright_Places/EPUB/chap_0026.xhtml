  <body dir="auto"><h1>VIOLET</h1><h2>138 days to go</h2><p>Sunday night. My bedroom. I flip through our notebook, Finch’s and mine. I pick up the pen
he gave me and find a blank page. Bookmarks and the Purina Tower aren’t official
wanderings, but this doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be remembered too.</p><p>Stars in the sky
, 
stars on the ground. It’s hard to tell where the sky ends and the earth begins. I
feel the need to say something grand and 
poeticbut
 the only thing I come up with is “It’s lovely. ”</p><p>He says
, 
“ ‘Lovely’ is a lovely word that should be used more often. ”</p><p>Then I get an idea. Over my desk, I’ve got this enormous bulletin board, and on it I’ve
tacked black-and-white photographs of writers at work. I take these down and dig through
my desk until I come up with a stack of brightly colored Post-its. On one of them, I write:</p><p>lovely.</p><p>Half an hour later, I stand back and look at the board. It is covered in fragments—some are
words or sentences that may or may not become story ideas. Others are lines I like from
books. In the last column, I have a section for 
New Nameless Web Magazine.
 On three separate
Post-its I’ve tacked beneath it: 
Lit. Love. Life.
 I’m not sure what these are supposed to be—
categories or articles or just nice-sounding words.</p><p>Even though it isn’t much yet, I take a picture and send it to Finch. I write: 
Look what
you’ve got me doing. 
Every half hour, I check for a response, but by the time I go to bed, I
still haven’t heard from him.</p>
