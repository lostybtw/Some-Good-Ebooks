  <body dir="auto"><h1>FINCH</h1><h2>Day 30 (and I am awake)</h2><p>In gym, Charlie Donahue and I stand on the baseball field, way beyond third base. We’ve
discovered this is the best place to be if you want to have a conversation. Without even
looking, he catches a ball that comes zinging our way and flings it back to home. Every
athletic coach at Bartlett High has been trying to recruit him since he first walked through the
school doors, but he refuses to be a black stereotype. His extracurriculars are chess, yearbook,
and euchre club because, as he says, these are things that will make him stand out on college
applications.</p><p>Right now, he crosses his arms and frowns at me. “Is it true you almost drowned Roamer?”</p><p>“Something like that.”</p><p>“Always finish what you start, man.”</p><p>“I thought it was a good idea not to get myself incarcerated before I have a chance to get
laid again.”</p><p>“Getting arrested might actually increase your odds of getting laid.”</p><p>“Not the kind of odds I’m looking for.”</p><p>“So what’s up with you anyway? Look at you.”</p><p>“I wish I could take the credit, but let’s face it, the gym uniform is universally flattering.”</p><p>“Cheeky wanker.” He calls me this even though I’m no longer British. Good-bye, Fiona.
Good-bye, flat. Good-bye, Abbey Road. “I mean, you’ve been Dirtbag Finch for a while now.
Before that, you were Badass Finch for a couple weeks. You’re slipping.”</p><p>“Maybe I like Dirtbag Finch.” I adjust the knit cap, and it suddenly hits me—which Finch
does Violet like? The thought burns a little, and I can feel my mind latch onto it. 
Which Finch
does she like? What if it’s only a version of the real Finch?</p><p>Charlie offers me a cigarette and I shake my head.</p><p>“What’s going on with you? Is she your girlfriend?”</p><p>“Violet?”</p><p>“Did you hit that yet, or what?”</p><p>“My friend, you are a total and complete pig. And I’m just having a good time.”</p><p>“Obviously not too good a time.”</p><p>Roamer comes up to bat, which means we have to pay attention, because not only is he the
school’s star baseball player (second only to Ryan Cross), he likes to aim right at us. If it
wouldn’t get him in trouble, he’d probably come over here now and smash my head in with
the bat for nearly drowning him.</p><p>Sure enough, the ball comes flying at us, and, cigarette between his teeth, Charlie steps
backward once, twice, once more, as if he’s not in any hurry, as if he knows he’s got this. He
holds out his glove and the ball falls right into it. Roamer yells about fifteen hundred</p>

        <p>expletives as Charlie sends it flying right back.</p><p>I nod over at Mr. Kappel, our teacher, who also happens to be the baseball coach. “You do
know that every time you do that, you make him die just a little.”</p><p>“Kappy or Roamer?”</p><p>“Both.”</p><p>He flashes me a rare grin. “I do.”</p><p>In the locker room, Roamer corners me. Charlie is gone. Kappel is in his office. The guys who
haven’t left yet fade away into the background, like they’re trying to go invisible. Roamer
leans in so close, I can smell the eggs he had for breakfast. “You’re dead, freak.”</p><p>Much as I would love to kick the shit out of Gabe Romero, I’m not going to. 1) Because he’s
not worth getting into trouble for. And 2) because I remember the look on Violet’s face at the
river when she told me to let him go.</p><p>So I count. One, two, three, 
four
, 
five
 ...</p><p>I will hold it in. I won’t punch him in the face.</p><p>I will he good.</p><p>And then he slams me into the locker and, before I can even blink, punches me in the eye,
and then again in the nose. It’s all I can do to stay on my feet, and I am counting like hell
now because I want to kill the son of a bitch.</p><p>I wonder, if I count long enough, whether I can go back in time, all the way to the
beginning of eighth grade, before I was weird and before anyone noticed me and before I
opened my mouth and talked to Roamer and before they called me “freak” and I was awake
all the time and everything felt okay and somewhat normal, whatever normal is, and people
actually looked at me—not to stare, not to watch for what I’d do next, but looked at me like,
Oh hey
, 
what’s up
, 
man
, 
what’s up
, 
buddy?
 
I wonder, if I count backward, whether I can go
back and take Violet Markey with me and then move forward with her so we have more time.
Because it’s time I fear.</p><p>And me.</p><p>I’m afraid of me.</p><p>“Is there a problem here?” Kappel stands a couple of feet away, eyeing us. He’s got a
baseball bat in his hand, and I can hear him at home telling the wife, “The trouble isn’t the
freshmen. It’s the older ones, once they start working out and hitting those growth spurts.
That’s when you gotta protect yourself, no matter what.”</p><p>“No problem,” I tell him. “No trouble.”</p><p>If I know Kappel like I know Kappel, he’s never going to take this to Principal Wertz, not
when one of his best baseball players is involved. I wait to get blamed for it. I’m all set to
hear the details of my detention or expulsion, even if I’m the only one bleeding. But then
Kappy says, “We’re done here, Finch. You can go.”</p><p>I wipe the blood off and smile at Roamer as I walk away.</p><p>“Not so fast, Romero,” I hear Kappy bark, and the sound of Roamer groveling almost makes
the pain worth it.</p><p>I stop at my locker to get my books, and sitting on top of them is what looks like the Hoosier
Hill rock. I pick it up, flip it over, and sure enough: 
Your turn,
 
it says.</p>

        <p>“What’s that?” Brenda wants to know. She takes it out of my hand and examines it. “I don’t
get it. ‘Your turn’? Your turn for what?”</p><p>“It’s a private joke. Only the really sexy, really cool people know what it means.”</p><p>She punches my arm. “Then you must have no clue. What happened to your eye?”</p><p>“Your boyfriend. Roamer?”</p><p>She makes a face. “I never liked him.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Shut up. I hope you broke his nose.”</p><p>“I’m trying to rise above.”</p><p>“Wuss.” She walks with me, chatting away: 
Are you totally into Violet Markey, like the forever
kind or the she’s-interesting-for-right-now kind? What about Suze Haines? Didn’t you used to have a
thing for her? What about the three Brianas and those macrame girls? What would you do if Emma
Watson fell from the sky right now? Would you even want to feel her up or would you tell her to
leave you alone? Do you think my hair would look better purple or blue? Do you think I need to lose
weight? Be honest Do you think any guy will ever have sex with me or love me for who I am?</p><p>I answer, “Right,” “I don’t think so,” “Of course,” “You never can tell,” and all the while
I’m thinking about Violet Markey, lock picker.</p>
