  <body dir="auto"><h1>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h1><p>In June of 2013, two days after finishing up work on my seventh book and sending it off to
my New York publisher, I had an idea for another story, in spite of the fact that I was burned
out and ready for a much-needed break—I’ve been writing back-to-back books for the past
couple of years.</p><p>This idea was different, however. For one thing, it was personal. For another, it was YA.
I’ve spent my career in adult fiction and nonfiction but, creatively, I was ready for something
different.</p><p>I wanted to write something edgy.</p><p>I wanted to write something contemporary.</p><p>I wanted to write something tough, hard, sad, but funny.</p><p>I wanted to write from a boy’s point of view.</p><p>In July, I signed with the most wonderful and amazing agent (champion, partner, editor) a
girl could have. Thank you to the incomparable Kerry Sparks for believing in that first fifty
pages and me. No one will ever know what her belief and enthusiasm meant at that particular
time in my life. I wake up every day counting my lucky stars for Kerry and all the fantastic
folks at Levine Greenberg Rostan (especial thanks to Monika Verma and Elizabeth Fisher).
They make me lovely.</p><p>So does Allison Wortche, my brilliant editor, who is as savvy and insightful as she is warm
and kind, and who is as invested in Finch and Violet as I am. Their story would not be the
same without her skilled hand. She and the entire team at Knopf and Random House
Children’s Books (President and Publisher Barbara Marcus; Vice President and Publishing
Director Nancy Hinkel; Senior Vice President and Associate Publisher Judith Haut; Isabel
Warren-Lynch, Alison Impey, and Stephanie Moss in Design; Artie Bennett, as well as aces
Renee Cafiero and Katharine Wiencke, in Copyediting; Managing Editor Shasta Clinch; Tim
Terhune and Barbara Cho in Production; Pam White and Jocelyn Lange in Sub Rights; Felicia
Frazier, John Adamo, Kim Lauber, Lynn Kestin, Stephanie O’Cain, Adrienne Waintraub, Laura
Antonacci, Dominique Cimina, Lydia Finn, and the rest of Sales, Marketing, and Publicity)
have created the brightest of places for me to live, breathe, and work, and I am thrilled out of
my head to be there.</p><p>I’m also thrilled to be working with my wondrous film agent, Sylvie Rabineau, and RWSG
Literary Agency.</p><p>Thank you to my family and friends for unwavering support, even when I am insufferably
consumed by my work (which is most of the time). I couldn’t do it without you. Special
thanks to my favorite cousin, Annalise von Sprecken, my consultant on all things teen-related
and the person who gave me “_is life.”</p><p>Thank you to Louis, love of my life and partner in more ways than one, who has had to
endure hours of worrying, brainstorming, outlining, suicide-fact reciting, querying (“What if
Violet and Finch met on the bell tower ledge?” “What if Finch and Roamer used to be
friends?” “What if Amanda was at Life Is Life too?”), not to mention hours of One Direction
listening (my own personal Boy Parade). He, more than anyone else (with the exception of</p>

        <p>our three literary cats), has lived this book with me.</p><p>Thank you, John Ivers (Blue Flash, Blue Too) and Mike Carmichael (World’s Biggest Ball of
Paint), for creating such uniquely awesome, wander-worthy sites, and for letting me use your
real names.</p><p>Thank you to my very first editor, Will Schwalbe, who remains a wise mentor and
cherished friend. And to Amanda Brower and Jennifer Gerson Uffalussy for leading me to
Kerry Sparks.</p><p>Thank you, Briana Harley, for being my go-to one-girl band of a YA focus group. Thank
you, Lara Yacoubian, for being the World’s Best Assistant Ever.</p><p>Thanks to the 
Germ
 girls and guys for all you are and do, particularly Louis, Jordan, Briana
Bailey, Shannon, Shelby, and Lara. You are the prettiest girls (and boys) anywhere.</p><p>Thank you to the generous people (who wish to remain nameless) who shared their
personal stories of mental illness, depression, and suicide. And to the experts at the American
Association of Suicidology, the Mayo Clinic, and the National Institute of Mental Health.</p><p>Thanks most of all to my beautiful mother and fellow author, Penelope Niven, who made
the world lovelier just by being in it. She was my best friend. She was my best everything.</p><p>We used to say to each other, “You are my best.” And she was. And she always will be. She
taught me from childhood that my mountain was waiting, and she never stopped encouraging
me to keep climbing. Her unexpected death on August 28, 2014, was the single worst event of
my life. This book, and all the books to follow, are because of her and for her. To quote
Theodore Finch, 
You are all the colors in one
, 
at full brightness.</p><p>Lastly, thanks to my great-grandfather Olin Niven. And to the boy I loved who died too
soon, but who left me a song.</p><p>And in two weeks we’ll fly again,
perhaps a Chinese dinner then.</p><p>You make me happy, you make me smile.</p>
