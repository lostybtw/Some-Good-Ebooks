some are missing. I wish my heart wouldn’t beat so 
fast.</p><p>I get out the books again and read the good words Decca left behind, but they blur on the
page so that they don’t make sense. I can’t concentrate.</p><p>And then I start to clean and organize. I take down every single note until the wall is blank.
I shove them into a trash bag, but this isn’t enough, so I decide to paint. I’m sick of the red
walls of my room. The color is too dark and depressing. 
This is what I need,
 I think. 
A change
of scenery. This is why the room feels off</p><p>I get into Little Bastard and drive to the nearest hardware store and buy primer and ten
gallons of blue paint because I’m not sure how much it will take.</p><p>It takes many, many coats to cover the red. No matter what I do, it seeps right through, like
the walls are bleeding.</p><p>By midnight, the paint still isn’t dry, and so I gather up the black comforter and shove it into
the back of the linen closet in the hall, and I dig around until I find an old blue comforter of
Kate’s. I spread this on my bed. I open the windows and move my bed into the middle of the
room, and then I climb under the blanket and go to sleep.</p><p>The next day, I paint the walls again. It takes two days for them to hold the color, which is
the clear, bright blue of a swimming pool. I lie on my bed feeling easier, like I can catch my
breath. 
Now we’re talking,
 I think. 
Yes.</p><p>The only thing I leave alone is the ceiling, because white contains all the wavelengths of
the visible spectrum at full brightness. Okay, this is technically true of white light and not
white paint, but I don’t care. I tell myself that all the colors are there anyway, and this gives
me an idea. I think of writing it as a song, but instead I sign onto the computer and send a
message to Violet. 
You are all the colors in one, at full brightness.</p>
