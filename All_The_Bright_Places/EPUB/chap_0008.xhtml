  <body dir="auto"><h1>FINCH’S RULES FOR WANDERING</h1><p>1. There are no rules, because life is made up of too many rules as it is.</p><p>2. But there are three “guidelines” (which sounds less rigid than “rules”):</p><p>a) No using our phones to get us there. We have to do this strictly old-school, which
means learning to read actual maps.</p><p>b) We alternate choosing places to go, but we also have to be willing to go where the
road takes us. This means the grand, the small, the bizarre, the poetic, the beautiful,
the ugly, the surprising. Just like life. But absolutely, unconditionally, resolutely
nothing ordinary.</p><p>c) At each site, we leave something, almost like an offering. It can be our own private
game of geocaching (“the recreational activity of hunting for and finding a hidden
object by means of GPS coordinates posted on a website”), only not a game, and just
for us. The rules of geocaching say “take something, leave something.” The way I
figure it, we stand to get something out of each place, so why not give something
back? Also, it’s a way to prove we’ve been there, and a way to leave a part of us
behind.</p>
