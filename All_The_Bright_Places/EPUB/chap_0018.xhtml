  <body dir="auto"><h1>FINCH</h1><h2>Day 13</h2><p>I throw rocks at her window but she doesn’t come down. I think about ringing the doorbell,
but that would only wake the parents. I try waiting her out, but the curtain doesn’t move, and
the door doesn’t open, and it is really fucking cold, so finally I climb into Little Bastard and
go home.</p><p>I’m up the rest of the night making a list called “How to Stay Awake.” There’s the obvious
—Red Bull, caffeine, NoDoz and other drugs—but this isn’t about skipping a couple hours’
sleep, it’s about staying up and staying here for the long haul.</p><p>1. Run.</p><p>2. Write (this includes any thoughts I don’t want to have—write them out fast so they’re
out of me and on the paper).</p><p>3. Along those lines, accept any and all thoughts (don’t be afraid of them no matter what
they are).</p><p>4. Surround myself with water.</p><p>5. Plan.</p><p>6. Drive anywhere and everywhere, even when there’s nowhere to go. (Note: There’s
always somewhere to go.)</p><p>7. Play guitar.</p><p>8. Organize room, notes, thoughts. (This is different from planning.)</p><p>9. Do whatever it takes to remind myself that I’m still here and have a say.</p><p>10. Violet.</p>
