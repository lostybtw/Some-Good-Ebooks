are inside the rest of us, but I can’t help thinking she’s more than that and she’s got other
elements going on that no one’s ever heard of, ones that make her stand apart from
everybody else. I feel this brief panic as I think, 
What would happen if one of those elements
malfunctioned or just stopped working altogether?
 I make myself push this aside and concentrate
on the feel of her skin until I no longer see molecules but Violet.</p><p>As the song plays on the turntable, I hear one of my own that’s taking shape:</p><p>You make me love you
 ...</p><p>The line plays over and over in my head as we move from standing to lying down.</p><p>You make me love you
You make me love you
You make me love you
 ...</p><p>I want to get up and write it down and tack it to the wall. But I don’t.</p><p>Afterward, as we lie tangled up, kind of winded and Huh and Wow, she says, “I should get
home.” We lie there a little longer and then she says it again. “I should get home.”</p><p>In the car, we hold hands and don’t talk about what happened. Instead of driving to her
house, I take a detour. When I get to the Purina Tower, she wants to know what we’re doing.</p><p>I grab the blanket and pillow from the back and say, “I’m going to tell you a story.”</p><p>“Up there?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>We climb up the steel ladder, all the way to the top. The air must be cold because I can see
my breath, but I feel warm all the way through. We walk past the Christmas tree and I spread
out the blanket. We lie down and wrap ourselves in and then I kiss her.</p><p>She is smiling as she pushes me away. “So tell me this story.” We lie back, her head on my
shoulder, and, as if I ordered them, the stars are clear and bright. There are millions of them.</p><p>I say, “There was this famous British astronomer named Sir Patrick Moore. He hosted a BBC
television program called 
Sky at Night,
 which ran for something like fifty-five years. Anyway,
on April 1, 1976, Sir Patrick Moore announced on his show that something extraordinary was
getting ready to happen in the skies. At exactly 9:47 a.m., Pluto would pass directly behind
Jupiter, in relation to the earth. This was a rare alignment that meant the combined</p>

        <p>gravitational force of those two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, which would
temporarily counteract gravity here on earth and make people weigh less. He called this the
Jovian-Plutonian gravitational effect.”</p><p>Violet is heavy against my arm, and for a minute I wonder if she’s asleep.</p><p>“Patrick Moore told viewers that they could experience the phenomenon by jumping in the
air at the exact moment the alignment occurred. If they did, they would feel weightless, like
they were floating.”</p><p>She shifts a little.</p><p>“At 9:47 a.m., he told everyone, ‘Jump now!’ Then he waited. One minute passed, and the
BBC switchboard lit up with hundreds of people calling in to say they’d felt it. One woman
phoned from Holland to say she and her husband had swum around the room together. A
man called from Italy to say he and his friends had been seated at a table, and all of them—
including the table—rose into the air. Another man called from the States to say he and his
children had flown like kites in their backyard.”</p><p>Violet is propped up now, looking at me. “Did those things actually happen?”</p><p>“Of course not. It was an April Fool’s joke.”</p><p>She smacks my arm and lies back down. “You had me believing.”</p><p>“But I bring it up to let you know that this is the way I feel right now. Like Pluto and
Jupiter are aligned with the earth and I’m floating.”</p><p>In a minute, she says, “You’re so weird, Finch. But that’s the nicest thing anyone’s ever said
to me.”</p>
