  <body dir="auto"><h1>FINCH</h1><h2>Day 6 (still) of being awake</h2><p>By lunch, it’s all over school that Violet Markey saved Theodore Finch from jumping off the
bell tower. On my way to U.S. Geography, I walk behind a group of girls in the hallway who
are going on and on about it, no idea that I’m the one and only Theodore Finch.</p><p>They talk over each other in these high voices that always end in question marks, so that it
sounds like 
I heard he had a gun? I heard she had to wrestle it out of his hands? My cousin Stacey,
who goes to New Castle, says she and a friend were in Chicago and he was playing this club and he
totally hooked up with both of them? Well, my brother was there when he set off the firecrackers,
and he said before the police took him away, he was all “Unless you want to reimburse me, I’ll wait
for the finale”?</p><p>Apparently, I’m tragic and dangerous. 
Oh yeah,
 I think. 
That’s right. I am here and now and
not just awake, but Awake, and everyone can just deal with it because I am the second freakin’
coming.
 I lean in and say to them, “I heard he did it over a girl,” and then I swagger all the
way to class.</p><p>Inside the classroom, I take my seat, feeling infamous and invincible and twitchy and
strangely exhilarated, as if I just escaped, well, death. I look around, but no one is paying any
attention to me or Mr. Black, our teacher, who is literally the largest man I have ever seen.
He has a red, red face that always makes him look like he’s on the verge of heatstroke or a
heart attack, and he wheezes when he talks.</p><p>The whole time I’ve been in Indiana, which is all my life—the purgatory years, I call them
—we’ve apparently lived just eleven miles away from the highest point in the state. No one
ever told me, not my parents or my sisters or my teachers, until now, right this minute, in the
“Wander Indiana” section of U.S. Geography—the one that was implemented by the school
board this year in an effort to “enlighten students as to the rich history available in their own
home state and inspire Hoosier pride.”</p><p>No joke.</p><p>Mr. Black settles into his chair and clears his throat. “What better and more ... appropriate
way to start off ... the semester than by beginning ... with the highest point?” Because of the
wheezing, it’s hard to tell if Mr. Black is all that impressed by the information he’s relaying.
“Hoosier Hill is ... 1,257 feet above sea level ... and it’s in the backyard ... of a family home.
... In 2005, an Eagle ... Scout from Kentucky ... got permission to ... build a trail and picnic
area ... and put up a sign....”</p><p>I raise my hand, which Mr. Black ignores.</p><p>As he talks, I leave my hand in the air and think, 
What if I went there and stood on that
point? Would things look different from 1,257 feet? It doesn’t seem very high, but they’re proud of
it, and who am I to say 1,257feet isn’t something to be impressed by?</p>

        </div>
        <p>Finally, he nods at me, his lips so tight, it looks like he’s swallowed them. “Yes, Mr. Finch?”
He sighs the sigh of a one-hundred-year-old man and gives me an apprehensive, distrustful
look.</p><p>“I suggest a field trip. We need to see the wondrous sights of Indiana while we still can,
because at least three of us in this room are going to graduate and leave our great state at the
end of this year, and what will we have to show for it except a subpar public school
education from one of the worst school systems in the nation? Besides, a place like this is
going to be hard to take in unless we see it. Kind of like the Grand Canyon or Yosemite. You
need to be there to really appreciate its splendor.”</p><p>I’m only being about twenty percent sarcastic, but Mr. Black says, “Thank you, Mr. Finch,”
in a way that means the direct opposite of thank you. I start drawing hills on my notebook in
tribute to our state’s highest point, but they look more like formless lumps or airborne snakes
—I can’t decide.</p><p>“Theodore is correct that some ... of you will leave ... here at the end of ... this school year
to go ... somewhere else. You’ll be departing our ... great state, and before ... you do, you
should ... see it. You should ... wander....”</p><p>A noise from across the room interrupts him. Someone has come in late and dropped a
book and then, in picking up the book, has upset all her other books so that everything has
gone tumbling. This is followed by laughter because we’re in high school, which means we’re
predictable and almost anything is funny, especially if it’s someone else’s public humiliation.
The girl who dropped everything is Violet Markey, the same Violet Markey from the bell
tower. She turns beet red and I can tell she wants to die. Not in a jumping-from-a-great-height
kind of way, but more along the lines of 
Please, earth, swallow me whole.</p><p>I know this feeling better than I know my mom or my sisters or Charlie Donahue. This
feeling and I have been together all my life. Like the time I gave myself a concussion during
kickball in front of Suze Haines; or the time I laughed so hard that something flew out of my
nose and landed on Gabe Romero; or the entire eighth grade.</p><p>And so, because I’m used to it and because this Violet girl is about three dropped pencils
away from crying, I knock one of my own books onto the floor. All eyes shift to me. I bend to
pick it up and purposely send the others flying—boomeranging into walls, windows, heads—
and just for good measure, I tilt my chair over so I go crashing. This is followed by snickers
and applause and a “freak” or two, and Mr. Black wheezing, “If you’re done ... Theodore ...
I’d like to continue.”</p><p>I right myself, right the chair, take a bow, collect my books, bow again, settle in, and smile
at Violet, who is looking at me with what can only be described as surprise and relief and
something else—worry, maybe. I’d like to think there’s a little lust mixed in too, but that
could be wishful thinking. The smile I give her is the best smile I have, the one that makes my
mother forgive me for staying out too late or for just generally being weird. (Other times, I
see my mom looking at me—when she looks at me at all—like she’s thinking: 
Where in the hell
did you come from? You must get it from your father’s side.)</p><p>Violet smiles back. Immediately, I feel better, because she feels better and because of the
way she smiles at me, as if I’m not something to be avoided. This makes twice in one day that
I’ve saved her. 
Tenderhearted Theodore,
 my mother always says. 
Too tenderhearted for his own
good.
 It’s meant as a criticism and I take it as one.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Mr. Black fixes his eyes on Violet and then me. “As I was saying ... your project for
this ... class is to report on ... at least two, preferably three ... wonders of Indiana.” I want to
ask, 
Wonders or wanders?
 But I’m busy watching Violet as she concentrates on the chalkboard,
the corner of her mouth still turned up.</p><p>Mr. Black goes on about how he wants us to feel free to choose the places that strike our
fancy, no matter how obscure or far away. Our mission is to go there and see each one, take
pictures, shoot video, delve deep into their history, and tell him just what it is about these
places that makes us proud to be a Hoosier. If it’s possible to link them in some way, all the
better. We have the rest of the semester to complete the project, and we need to take it
seriously.</p><p>“You will work ... in teams of ... two. This will count ... for thirty-five percent ... of your
final grade....”</p><p>I raise my hand again. “Can we choose our partners?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“I choose Violet Markey.”</p><p>“You may work that out... with her after class.”</p><p>I shift in my seat so I can see her, elbow on the back of my chair. “Violet Markey, I’d like to
be your partner on this project.”</p><p>Her face turns pink as everyone looks at her. Violet says to Mr. Black, “I thought if there
was something else I could do—maybe research and write a short report.” Her voice is low,
but she sounds a little pissed. “I’m not ready to ...”</p><p>He interrupts her. “Miss Markey, I’m going ... to do you the biggest ... favor of your life.
... I’m going to say ... no.”</p><p>“No?”</p><p>“No. It is a new year.... It is time to get... back on the camel.”</p><p>A few people laugh at this. Violet looks at me and I can see that, yes, she is pissed, and it’s
then I remember the accident. Violet and her sister, sometime last spring. Violet lived, the
sister died. This is why she doesn’t want attention.</p><p>The rest of class time is spent telling us about places Mr. Black thinks we might enjoy and
that, no matter what, we must see before we graduate—the usual humdrum tourist spots like
Conner Prairie, the Levi Coffin House, the Lincoln Museum, and James Whitcomb Riley’s
boyhood home—even though I know that most of us will stay right here in this town until we
die.</p><p>I try to catch Violet’s eye again, but she doesn’t look up. Instead, she shrinks low in her seat
and stares straight ahead.</p><p>Outside of class, Gabe Romero blocks my way. As usual, he’s not alone. Amanda Monk waits
just behind, hip jutted out, Joe Wyatt and Ryan Cross on either side of her. Good, easygoing,
decent, nice-guy Ryan, athlete, A student, vice president of the class. The worst thing about
him is that since kindergarten he’s known exactly who he is.</p><p>Roamer says, “I better not catch you looking at me again.”</p><p>“I wasn’t looking at you. Believe me, there are at least a hundred other things in that room
I’d look at before you, including Mr. Black’s large, naked ass.”</p><p>“Faggot.”</p>
        <div style="width: 99.68627450980392%;">
        <img src="images/img_0017.png" alt="Picture #17"/>
        </div>
        <p>Because Roamer and I have been sworn enemies since middle school, he shoves the books
out of my hands, and even though this is right out of Fifth-Grade Bullying 101, I feel a
familiar black grenade of anger—like an old friend—go off in my stomach, the thick, toxic
smoke from it rising up and spreading through my chest. It’s the same feeling I had last year
in that instant before I picked up a desk and hurled it—not at Roamer, like he wants everyone
to believe, but at the chalkboard in Mr. Geary’s room.</p><p>“Pick ’em up, bitch.” Roamer walks past me, knocking me in the chest—hard—with his
shoulder. I want to slam his head into a locker and then reach down his throat and pull his
heart out through his mouth, because the thing about being Awake is that everything in you
is alive and aching and making up for lost time.</p><p>But instead I count all the way to sixty, a stupid smile plastered on my stupid face. 
I will not
get detention. I will not get expelled. I will be good. I will be quiet. I will be still.</p><p>Mr. Black watches from the doorway, and I try to give him a casual nod to show him
everything’s cool, everything’s under control, everything’s fine, nothing to see, palms aren’t
itching, skin isn’t burning, blood isn’t pumping, please move along. I’ve made a promise to
myself that this year will be different. If I keep ahead of everything, and that includes me, I
should be able to stay awake and here, and not just semi-here but here as in present as in
now.</p><p>The rain has stopped, and in the parking lot Charlie Donahue and I lean against his car under
the washed-out January sun as he talks about the thing he most loves talking about other
than himself—sex. Our friend Brenda stands listening, books clutched against her broad,
broad chest, hair shining pink and red.</p><p>Charlie spent winter break working at the Mall Cinema, where he apparently let all the hot
girls sneak in without paying. This got him more action than even he knew what to do with,
mostly in the handicapped row in the back, the one missing armrests.</p><p>He nods at me. “What about you?”</p><p>“What about me?”</p><p>“Where were you?”</p><p>“Around. I didn’t feel like coming to school, so I hit the interstate and didn’t look back.”
There’s no way of explaining the Asleep to my friends, and even if there was, there’s no need.
One of the things I like best about Charlie and Bren is that I don’t have to explain myself. I
come, I go, and 
Oh well, it’s just Finch.</p><p>Charlie nods again. “What we need to do is get you laid.” It’s an indirect reference to the
bell tower incident. If I get laid, I won’t try to kill myself. According to Charlie, getting laid
fixes everything. If only world leaders would get laid well and regularly, the world’s problems
might disappear.</p><p>Brenda frowns at him. “You’re a pig, Charlie.”</p><p>“You love me.”</p><p>“You wish I’d love you. Why don’t you be more like Finch? He’s a gentleman.” There aren’t
many people who would say this about me, but the great thing about this life of ours is that
you can be someone different to everybody.</p><p>I say, “You can leave me out of it.”</p><p>Bren shakes her head. “No, I’m serious. Gentlemen are rare. They’re like virgins or</p>
        <div style="width: 99.68627450980392%;">
        <img src="images/img_0018.png" alt="Picture #18"/>
        </div>
        <p>leprechauns. If I ever get married, I’m going to marry one.”</p><p>I can’t resist saying, “A virgin or a leprechaun?” She slugs me in the arm.</p><p>“There’s a difference between a gentleman and a guy with no play.” Charlie nods at me.
“No offense, man.”</p><p>“None taken.” It’s true, after all, at least compared to him, and actually what he means is
that I have bad luck with women. Something about going for the bitchy ones or the crazy
ones or the ones who pretend not to know me when other people are around.</p><p>Anyway, I’m barely listening, because over Bren’s shoulder I see her again—Violet. I can
already feel myself falling hard, something I’ve been known to do. (Suze Haines, Laila
Collman, Annalise Lemke, the three Brianas—Briana Harley, Briana Bailey, Briana
Boudreau ...) All because she smiled at me. But it was a damn good smile. A genuine one,
which is hard to come by these days. Especially when you’re me, Theodore Freak, Resident
Aberration.</p><p>Bren turns around to see what I’m looking at. She shakes her head at me, her mouth all
smirked up in a way that makes me protect my arm. “God, you guys are all the same.”</p><p>At home, my mother is talking on the phone and defrosting one of the casseroles my sister
Kate prepares at the start of each week. Mom waves and then keeps right on. Kate runs down
the stairs, swipes her car keys from the counter, and says, “Later, loser.” I have two sisters—
Kate, just one year older than I am, and Decca, who’s eight. Clearly, she was a mistake, which
she figured out at the age of six. But we all know if anyone is the mistake here, it’s me.</p><p>I go upstairs, wet shoes squeaking against the floor, and shut the door to my room. I pull
out something old on vinyl without checking what it is and slap it onto the turntable I found
in the basement. The record bumps and scratches, sounding like something from the 1920s.
I’m in a Split Enz kind of phase right now, hence the sneakers. I’m trying out Theodore Finch,
’80s kid, and seeing how he fits.</p><p>I fish through my desk for a cigarette, stick it in my mouth, and remember as I’m reaching
for my lighter that Theodore Finch, ’80s kid, doesn’t smoke. God, I hate him, the clean-cut,
eager little prick. I leave the cigarette in my mouth unlit, trying to chew the nicotine out, and
pick up the guitar, play along, then give it up and sit down at the computer, swinging my
chair around so it’s backward, the only way I can compose.</p><p>I type: 
January 5. Method: Bell tower of school. On a scale of one to ten on the how-
close-did-l-come scale: five. Facts: Jumping increases on full moons and holidays. One
of the more famous jumpers was Roy Raymond, founder of Victoria’s Secret. Related
fact: In 1912, a man named Franz Reichelt jumped off the Eiffel Tower wearing a
parachute suit he designed himself. He jumped to test his invention—he expected to fly
—but instead he fell straight down, hitting the ground like a meteor and leaving a 5.9-
inch-deep crater from the impact. Did he mean to kill himself? Doubtful. I think he was
just cocky, and also stupid.</p><p>A quick internet search turns up the information that only five to ten percent of all suicides
are committed by jumping (so says Johns Hopkins). Apparently, jumping as a means of killing
oneself is usually chosen for convenience, which is why places like San Francisco, with its
Golden Gate Bridge (the world’s top suicide destination), are so popular. Here, all we have is
the Purina Tower and a 1,257-foot hill.</p>
