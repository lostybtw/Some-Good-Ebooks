all of us to get away.” She means away from home, but I think, more than that, she means
away from Finch.</p><p>I’m carrying our wandering notebook so that I can make notes on the buildings and the
history and anything interesting that I might want to share with him. My parents are
discussing how I can apply for spring admission next year and transfer from whatever school I
choose for fall.</p><p>I’m more worried about why Finch hasn’t answered my last three texts. I wonder if this is
the way it will be next year if I come to New York, or wherever I go—me trying to
concentrate on college, on life, when all I’m doing is thinking about him. I wonder if he’ll
come with me, or if our built-in ending is high school.</p><p>My mom says, “It’ll be here before we know it, and I’m not ready. I don’t think I’ll ever be
ready.”</p><p>“Don’t start crying, Mom. You promised. We’ve still got lots of time to go, and we don’t
know where I’m going to end up.”</p><p>My dad says, “Just an excuse to come see her and spend time in the city.” But his eyes go
damp too.</p><p>Even though they don’t say it, I can feel all the expectation and weight surrounding us. It
comes from the fact that they didn’t get to do this with their older daughter. They never got
to take her to college and wish her a good freshman year, be safe, come home and see us,
don’t forget we’re always a phone call away. It’s just one more moment they were cheated of,
and one more I have to make up for because I’m all that’s left.</p><p>Before the three of us lose it right there, in the middle of campus, I say, “Dad, what can you
tell us about the history of NYU?”</p><p>I have my own room at the hotel. It is narrow, with two windows, a dresser, and a giant TV
cabinet that looks as if it might fall on you and crush you while you sleep.</p><p>The windows are closed tight, but I can still hear the noises of the city, which are so
different from the ones I hear in Bartlett—sirens, yelling, music, garbage trucks rattling up
and down.</p><p>“So, do you have a special boy back home?” my mom’s agent asked over dinner.</p><p>“No one in particular,” I answered her, and my parents exchanged a look of relief and
conviction that yes, they did the right thing by chasing Finch away.</p><p>The only light in the room is from my laptop. I skim through our notebook, thick with</p>

        <p>words, and then through our Facebook messages—so many now—and then I write a new one,
quoting Virginia Woolf: 
“Let us wander whirling to the gilt chairs.... Are we not
acceptable, moon? Are we not lovely sitting together here ...?”</p>
