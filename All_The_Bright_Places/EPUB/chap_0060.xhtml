  <body dir="auto"><h1>VIOLET</h1><h2>Remaining wanderings 1 and 2</h2><p>Milltown, population 815, sits close to the Kentucky border. I have to stop and ask someone
how to get to the shoe trees. A woman named Myra points me toward a place called Devils
Hollow. It doesn’t take long to run out of paved road, and soon I’m driving down a narrow
dirt trail, looking up, which is what Myra told me to do. Just when I think I’m lost, I come to
a fourway intersection that sits surrounded by woods.</p><p>I pull the car over and get out. In the distance, I can hear the sound of kids yelling and
laughing. Trees stand at all four corners, their branches filled with shoes. Hundreds and
hundreds of shoes. Most are draped across the limbs by the laces like oversized Christmas
ornaments. Myra said she wasn’t sure how it began, or who left the first pair, but people
travel from all over just to decorate the trees. There’s a rumor that Larry Bird, the basketball
player, left a pair up there somewhere.</p><p>The quest is simple: leave a pair behind. I’ve brought a pair of green Chuck Taylors from
my closet, and a pair of yellow Keds from Eleanor’s. I stand, head tilted back, trying to decide
where to put them. I’ll hang them together on the original tree, the one heaviest with shoes,
which has been struck by lightning more than once—I can tell because the trunk looks dead
and black.</p><p>I pull a Sharpie from my pocket and write 
Ultraviolet Remarkey-able
 and the date on the
side of one of the Chuck Taylors. I hang them low on the original tree, which looks too fragile
to climb. I have to jump a little to reach the branch, and the shoes bob and twist before
settling. I hang Eleanor’s Keds beside them.</p><p>That’s it then. Nothing more to see. It’s a long way to drive for trees of old shoes, but I tell
myself not to look at it that way. There might be magic here too. I stand watching for it,
shading my eyes against the sun, and just before I walk back to the car I see them: way up on
the highest branch of the original tree, hanging all alone. A pair of sneakers with fluorescent
laces, 
TF
 in black on both shoes. A package of blue American Spirits pokes up from the inside
of one.</p><p>He was here.</p><p>I look around as if I might see him right now, but it’s just me and the kids who are laughing
and hollering from someplace nearby. When did he come? Was it after he left? Was it before
that?</p><p>Something nags at me as I stand there. 
The highest branch,
 I think. 
The highest branch.
 I
reach for my phone, but it’s in the car, and so I run the short distance, throw open the door,
and lean across the seat. I sit half in, half out, scrolling through my texts from Finch. Because
there aren’t many recent ones, it doesn’t take long to find it. 
I am on the highest branch. 
I
look at the date. A week after he left.</p>

        <p>He was here.</p><p>I read through the other texts: 
We are written in paint. I believe in signs. The glow of
Ultraviolet. It’s so lovely to be lovely in Private.</p><p>I find the map, my finger following the route to the next place. It’s hours away, northwest
of Muncie. I check the time, turn on the engine, and drive. I have a feeling I know where I’m
headed, and I hope it’s not too late.</p><p>The World’s Biggest Ball of Paint sits on the property of Mike Carmichael. Unlike the shoe
trees, it’s a designated tourist attraction. The ball not only has its own website, it’s listed in
the 
Guinness Book of World Records.
 It’s a little after four o’clock by the time I get to
Alexandria. Mike Carmichael and his wife are expecting me because I called them from the
road. I pull up to the structure where the ball apparently lives—in a kind of barnlike shed—
and knock on the door, my heart beating fast.</p><p>When there’s no answer, I try the handle, but it’s locked, and so I walk up to the house,
heart going faster because what if someone has been there since? What if they’ve painted
over whatever Finch might have written? It’ll be gone then, and I’ll never know, and it will be
like he was never even here.</p><p>I bang harder than I mean to on the front door, and at first I think they aren’t home, but
then a man with white hair and an expectant smile comes walking out, talking and shaking
my hand and telling me to call him Mike.</p><p>“Where are you from, young lady?”</p><p>“Bartlett.” I don’t mention that I’ve just come from Milltown.</p><p>“That’s a nice town, Bartlett. We go there sometimes to the Gaslight Restaurant.”</p><p>My heart is beating into my ears, and it’s so loud, I actually wonder if he can hear it. I
follow him to the barn-shed, and he says, “I started this ball of paint nearly forty years ago.
The way it came about, I was working in this paint store back in high school, back before you
were born, maybe back before your parents were born. I was playing catch in the store with a
friend and the baseball knocked over this can of paint. I thought, I wonder what would
happen if I painted it one thousand coats? So that’s what I did.” Mike says he donated that
ball to the Knightstown Children’s Home Museum, but in 1977 he decided to start another
one.</p><p>He nods at the barn and unlocks the door and we walk into a big, bright room that smells
like paint. There, in the middle, hangs this enormous ball, the size of a small planet. Paint
cans cover the floor and wall, and another wall is lined with photographs of the ball in
different stages. Mike tells me how he tries to paint it every day, and I cut him off and say,
“I’m so sorry, but a friend of mine was here recently, and I wanted to see if you remembered
him, and if maybe he might have written something on the ball.”</p><p>I describe Finch, and Mike rubs his chin and starts nodding. “Yep, yep. I remember him.
Nice young man. Didn’t stay long. Used this paint over here.” He leads me to a can of purple
paint, the color written on the lid: 
Violet.</p><p>I look at the ball, and it isn’t purple. It’s as yellow as the sun. I feel my heart sink. I look at
the floor and almost expect to see it lying there.</p><p>“The ball’s been painted over,” I say. I’m too late. Too late for Finch. Too late once again.</p><p>“Anyone who wants to write something, I get them to paint over it before they leave. That</p>
        <div style="width: 99.68627450980392%;">

        </div>
        <p>way it’s ready for the next person. A clean slate. Do you want to add a layer?”</p><p>I almost say no, but I didn’t bring anything to leave, and so I let him hand me a roller.
When he asks what color I want, I tell him blue like the sky. As he searches the cans, I stand
in place, unable to move or breathe. It’s like losing Finch all over again.</p><p>Then Mike is back and he has found a color that is the color of Finch’s eyes, which he can’t
possibly know or remember. I dip the roller into the tray and cover the yellow with blue.
There’s something soothing about the mindless, easy motion of it.</p><p>When I’m finished, Mike and I stand back and look at my work. “Don’t you want to write
anything?” he says.</p><p>“That’s okay. I’ll only have to cover it up.” And then no one will know I was here either.</p><p>I help him put the paint away and clean up a bit, and he tells me facts about the ball, like
that it weighs nearly 4,000 pounds and is made up of over 20,000 coats of paint. Then he
hands me a red book and a pen. “Before you leave, you have to sign.”</p><p>I flip through the pages until I find the first blank spot where I can write my name and the
date and a comment. My eyes run over the page, and then I see that only a few people were
here in April. I flip back a page, and there it is—there he is. 
Theodore Finch
, 
April 3.
“Today is your day. You’re off to Great Places! You’re off and away!”</p><p>I run my fingers over the words, the ones he wrote just weeks ago when he was here and
alive. I read them again and again, and then, on the first blank line, I sign my name and
write: 
“Your mountain is waiting. So ... get on your way!”</p><p>As I head home to Bartlett, I sing what I can remember of Finch’s Dr. Seuss song. When I
pass through Indianapolis, I think of trying to find the nursery where he collected flowers in
winter, but instead I keep driving east. They won’t be able to tell me anything about Finch or
why he died or what he wrote on the ball of paint. The only thing that makes me feel better is
that, whatever Finch wrote, it will always be there, underneath the layers.</p><p>I find my mom and dad in the family room, my dad listening to music on his headphones, my
mom grading papers. I say, “I need us to talk about Eleanor and not to forget that she
existed.” My dad removes his headphones. “I don’t want to pretend like everything’s fine if it
isn’t, like we’re fine if we’re not. I miss her. I can’t believe I’m here and she isn’t. I’m sorry we
went out that night. I need you to know that. I’m sorry I told her to take the bridge home. She
only went that way because I suggested it.”</p><p>When they try to interrupt me, I talk louder. “We can’t go backward. We can’t change
anything that happened. I can’t bring her back or bring Finch back. I can’t change the fact
that I sneaked around to see him when I told you it was over. I don’t want to tiptoe around
her or him or you anymore. The only thing it’s doing is making it harder for me to remember
the things I want to remember. It’s making it harder for me to remember her. Sometimes I try
to concentrate on her voice just so I can hear it again—the way she always said, ‘Hey there’
when she was in a good mood, and ‘Vi-o-let’ when she was annoyed. For some reason, these
are the easiest ones. I concentrate on them, and when I have them, I hold on to them because
I don’t ever want to forget how she sounded.”</p><p>My mom has started to cry, very, very quietly. My father’s face has gone gray-white.</p><p>“Like it or not, she was here and now she’s gone, but she doesn’t have to be completely
gone. That’s up to us. And like it or not, I loved Theodore Finch. He was good for me, even</p>

        <p>though you think he wasn’t and you hate his parents and you probably hate him, and even
though he went away and I wish he hadn’t, and I can never bring him back, and it might have
been my fault. So it’s good and it’s bad and it hurts, but I like thinking about him. If I think
about him, he won’t be completely gone either. Just because they’re dead, they don’t have to
be. And neither do we.”</p><p>My dad sits like a marble statue, but my mom gets up and kind of stumbles toward me. She
draws me in, and I think: 
That’s how she used to feel before any of this happened—strong and
sturdy
, 
like she could withstand a tornado.
 She is still crying, but she is solid and real, and just
in case, I pinch her skin, and she pretends not to notice.</p><p>She says, “Nothing that happened is your fault.”</p><p>And then I’m crying, and my dad is crying, one stoic tear at a time, and then his head is in
his hands and my mom and I move like one person over to him, and the three of us huddle
together, rocking a little back and forth, taking turns saying, “It’s okay. We’re okay. We’re all
okay.”</p>
