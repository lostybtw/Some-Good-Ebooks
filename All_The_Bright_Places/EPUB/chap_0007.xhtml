  <body dir="auto"><h1>Eleanor Markey, 18, a senior at Bartlett High School and member of the student
congress, lost control of her car on A Street Bridge at approximately 12:45 a.m.</h1><p>April 5. Icy conditions and speed may have caused the crash. Eleanor was
killed on impact. Her 16-year-old sister, Violet, a passenger in the vehicle,
sustained only minor injuries.</p><p>I sit reading and rereading this, a black feeling settling in the pit of my stomach. And then I
do something I swore I’d never do. I sign up for Facebook just so I can send her a friend
request. Having an account will make me look sociable and normal, and maybe work to offset
the whole meeting-on-the-verge-of-suicide situation, so that she’ll feel it’s safe to know me. I
take a picture of myself with my phone, decide I look too serious, take another one—too
goofy—and settle on the third, which is somewhere in between.</p><p>I sleep the computer so I don’t check every five minutes, and then I play the guitar, read a
few pages of 
Macbeth
 for homework, and eat dinner with Decca and my mom, a tradition that
started last year, after the divorce. Even though I’m not much into eating, dinner is one of the
most enjoyable parts of my day because I get to turn my brain off.</p><p>Mom says, “Decca, tell me what you learned today.” She makes sure to ask us about school
so that she feels she’s done her duty. This is her favorite way to start.</p><p>Dec says, “I learned that Jacob Barry is a jackass.” She has been swearing more often lately,
trying to get a reaction out of Mom, to see if she’s really listening.</p><p>“Decca,” Mom says mildly, but she is only half paying attention.</p><p>Decca goes on to tell us about how this boy named Jacob glued his hands to his desk just to
get out of a science quiz, but when they tried to separate skin from wood, his palms came off
with the glue. Decca’s eyes gleam like the eyes of a small, rabid animal. She clearly thinks he
deserved it, and then she says so.</p><p>Mom is suddenly listening. “Decca.” She shakes her head. This is the extent of her
parenting. Ever since my dad left, she’s tried really hard to be the cool parent. Still, I feel bad
for her because she loves him, even though, at his core, he’s selfish and rotten, and even
though he left her for a woman named Rosemarie with an accent over one of the letters—no
one can ever remember which—and because of something she said to me the day he left: “I
never expected to be single at forty.” It was the way she said it more than the words</p>

        <p>themselves. She made it sound so 
final</p><p>Ever since then, I’ve done what I could to be pleasant and quiet, making myself as small
and unseen as possible—which includes pretending to go to school when I’m asleep, as in 
the
Asleep
—so that I don’t add to the burden. I am not always successful.</p><p>“How was your day, Theodore?”</p><p>“Grand.” I push my food around my plate, trying to create a pattern. The thing about eating
is that there are so many other more interesting things to do. I feel the same way about
sleeping. Complete wastes of time.</p><p>Interesting fact: A Chinese man died from lack of sleep when he stayed awake for eleven days
straight as he attempted to watch every game in the European Championship (that’s soccer
; 
for
those, like me, who have no clue). On the eleventh night, he watched Italy beat Ireland 2-0, took a
shower, and fell asleep around five a.m. And
 died. 
No offense to the dead, but soccer is a really
stupid thing to stay awake for.</p><p>Mom has stopped eating to study my face. When she does pay attention, which isn’t often,
she tries hard to be understanding about my “sadness,” just like she tries hard to be patient
when Kate stays out all night and Decca spends time in the principal’s office. My mother
blames our bad behavior on the divorce and my dad. She says we just need time to work
through it.</p><p>Less sarcastically, I add, “It was okay. Uneventful. Boring. Typical.” We move on to easier
topics, like the house my mother is trying to sell for her clients and the weather.</p><p>When dinner is over, Mom lays a hand on my arm, fingertips barely touching the skin, and
says, “Isn’t it nice to have your brother back, Decca?” She says it as if I’m in danger of
disappearing again, right in front of their eyes. The slightly blaming note in her voice makes
me cringe, and I get the urge to go back to my room again and stay there. Even though she
tries to forgive my sadness, she wants to count on me as man of the house, and even though
she thinks I was in school for most of that four-almost-five-week period, I did miss a lot of
family dinners. She takes her fingers back and then we’re free, which is exactly how we act,
the three of us running off in three different directions.</p><p>Around ten o’clock, after everyone else has gone to bed and Kate still isn’t home, I turn on
the computer again and check my Facebook account.</p><p>Violet Markey accepted your friend request, 
it says.</p><p>And now we are friends.</p><p>I want to shout and jog around the house, maybe climb up onto the roof and spread my
arms wide but not jump off, not even think about it. But instead I hunch closer to the screen
and browse through her photos—Violet smiling with two people who must be her parents,
Violet smiling with friends, Violet smiling at a pep rally, Violet smiling cheek to cheek with
another girl, Violet smiling all alone.</p><p>I remember the picture of Violet and the girl from the newspaper. This is her sister,
Eleanor. She wears the same clunky glasses Violet had on today.</p><p>Suddenly a message appears in my inbox.</p><p>Violet: 
You ambushed me. In front of everyone.</p><p>Me: 
Would you have worked with me if I hadn’t?</p><p>Violet: 
I would have gotten out of it so I didn’t have to do it to begin with. Why do you
want me to do this project with you anyway?</p>

        <p>Me: 
Because our mountain is waiting.</p><p>Violet: 
What’s that supposed to mean?</p><p>Me: 
It means maybe you never dreamed of seeing Indiana, but, in addition to the fact
that we’re required to do this for school, and I’ve volunteered—okay, ambushed—you
into being my partner, here’s what I think: I think I’ve got a map in my car that wants to
be used, and I think there are places we can go that need to be seen. Maybe no one else
will ever visit them and appreciate them or take the time to think they’re important, but
maybe even the smallest places mean something. And if not, maybe they can mean
something to us. At the very least, by the time we leave, we know we will have seen it,
this great state of ours. So come on. Let’s go. Let’s count for something. Let’s get off
that ledge.</p><p>When she doesn’t respond, 
I 
write: 
I’m here if you want to talk.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>I imagine Violet at home right now, on the other side of the computer, her perfect mouth
with its perfect corners turned up, smiling at the screen, in spite of everything, no matter
what. 
Violet smiling.
 With one eye on my computer, I pick up the guitar, start making up
words, the tune not far behind.</p><p>I’m still here, and I’m grateful, because otherwise I would be missing this. Sometimes it’s
good to be awake.</p><p>“So not today,” I sing. “Because she smiled at me.”</p>
